Asset,Results
Bicycle,"A negative slope may suggest bicycles are an inferior good, that is, it is more common for poor households to have access to them. "
Cellphone,We see a quick increase in access to cellphones over time at all levels of welfare. 
Computer,Access to computers only increases at levels of welfare above the poverty lines. 
Electricity,Access to electricity is clearly lower for individuals below the 1.90 poverty line. 
Ever attend school,"This variable is technically not an asset, but we decided to include in this analysis. We can see positive slopes in every country, that is, poorer individuals are more likely to answer they have never attended any school. "
Fan,Having access to a fan is clearly related to welfare. Richer individuals may afford this luxury and may also be the only ones with access to electricity to be able to use a fan. 
Land phone,"Having access to a land phone is clearly becoming obsolete, especially compared to the levels of access to cellphone. "
Literacy,Literacy is increasing over time and still related to welfare. Illiteracy is clearly more common among the poorest individuals. 
Motorcar,Having access to a motorcar seems to be more common for rich individuals in Afghanistan and Bhutan. 
Motorcycle,"Having access to a motorcycle is more common than having access to a motorcar. Having access to motorcycles has become more frequent over time, especially among richer individuals.  "
Own house,"Compared to other assets, most households own the house they live in. Renting is common only among richer households in urban areas. "
Piped water,Only Bhutan shows having almost universal access to piped water. 
Radio,"Another good that may be becoming obsolete are radios, with less households reporting having access to a radio over time at all levels of welfare.  "
Refrigerator,"Having access to a refrigerator seems to be strongly related to welfare, with average access to it growing fast around the 3.2 poverty line. "
Sewage toilet,No country shows evidence of high access to sewage toilets. 
Sewing machine,Sewing machines seem to remain highly valuable in Afghanistan and Pakistan with more than 50% of individuals reporting having access to it. 
Television,Televisions are a highly-desirable durable asset and are clearly more common among richer households. Having access to a television depends on having access to electricity. Both electricity and television follow similar trends. 
Washing machine,Having access to a washing machine is clearly a luxury and only common among the wealthiest.
