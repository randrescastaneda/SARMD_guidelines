The household surveys contained in SARMD provide a rich and open source of data on economic behavior and expenditure patterns, demographics, educational attainment, employment, the acquisition of durable assets, and housing. The harmonization of these surveys allows to compare social and economic statistics among the eight countries in the region. These guidelines are intended to teach you everything you need to work efficiently with SARMD. You will learn how to access the microdata through the datalibweb system and how to perform basic (and not so basic) socioeconomic calculations. We will study how comparable household surveys are across the region and evaluate the quality of the harmonization process. We also provide several examples on how to conduct analysis at the regional or country level in our analytical notes.

["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction Interacting with data visualizations Parts of the book", " Chapter 1 Introduction The South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD) is a regional database of socioeconomic indicators established in 2014 and managed by the South Asia Region Team for Statistical Development (SARTSD). It follows the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) harmonization guidelines, including the construction of the welfare aggregate used for global poverty monitoring. It consists of raw household survey data, documentation, questionnaires, and a repository of do files to reconstruct harmonized variables, consumption aggregates, and poverty estimates. SARMD currently includes the eight countries in the region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), contemplates forty-three surveys, and contains close to a hundred harmonized variables covering the 1993-2017 period. SARMD follows the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) harmonization guidelines, including the construction of the welfare aggregate that is used for global poverty monitoring. Given that GMD contains a limited number of variables, SARMD provides users with a larger set of harmonized variables that are comparable across the countries of the South Asia region, though may not be comparable with countries from other regions. As GMD expands, new variables could be incorporated until users may be referred only to GMD. Harmonization facilitates the use of household data at a regional level because all the databases in SARMD have a common set of approximately 100 variables with the same variable names (for example, welfare), variable labels and value labels. Technically speaking, this does not mean that each variable in each dataset refers to the same thing. For example, even though the variable welfare refers to the per capita welfare aggregate used to calculate official poverty rates and inequality indicators, it may include imputed rents in some countries (e.g., Bhutan and Bangladesh), but not in others (e.g., India and Afghanistan). This is so because questionnaires, sample frames, recollection periods, and several other factors make a strict harmonization and perfect comparability impossible across countries. The best solution to lack of perfect comparability across countries is known as ex–post harmonization, which is a harmonization effort that starts from non-harmonized raw data. Two main approaches can be followed on ex–post harmonization: The minimum common denominator approach refers to harmonizing variables according to the minimum common set of characteristics that all datasets share with respect to one variable. For example, if the minimum number of industrial sectors common to all surveys in all countries were two (e.g., agriculture and non-agriculture), the harmonized variable industcat, which is a categorical variable for industrial sectors, would only have two values in all datasets. This approach guarantees that all the variables are fully comparable, but it suffers from loss of information. Imagine, for example, that a single survey in the SARMD collection only has these two categories for industrial sectors while all the other surveys have five or more. If that were the case, the industcat ex-post harmonized variable would not capture all the valuable information on industrial sectors across countries. The benchmark approach refers to harmonizing each variable according to a previously established ideal definition. For instance, at the beginning of the project, it could be agreed that the ideal number of industrial sectors should be ten (1 agriculture, 2 mining, 3 manufacturing, etc.). It would not matter whether any of the surveys has ten categories for industrial sectors. If some of them have more, then it would be necessary to aggregate some of the categories into broader ones. If some of them have less categories than ten, it might not be possible to disaggregate some of these categories into smaller ones. As you may imagine, no approach to harmonization is perfect. However, SARMD follows the benchmark approach. The main reason for choosing this approach is that household surveys get better over time, and the minimum common denominator approach applied to both old and new surveys would inevitably drag down the content of SARMD to the old surveys’ methodological structure. In contrast, the benchmark approach takes advantage of the structure of new surveys. Once the benchmark stops reflecting the features of newer surveys, there is always room for updating and refining the benchmark and readapting old surveys to it. Despite the disadvantages of ex–post harmonization, harmonized variables in SARMD may be used for research purposes in many ways. For example, household access to at least one bicycle (Yes=1, No=0) is averaged at a subnational (state or province) level and plotted in a map in Figure 1.1 for the most recent survey available in each country. Even though survey characteristics vary, and data comes from different years, having access to a bicycle seems to be significantly more common for households in Eastern India than in other areas of South Asia. Figure 1.1: Subnational averages for harmonized variables Interacting with data visualizations Many of the graphs in this book are interactive Tableau dashboards. Figure 1.1 above is an example where you may visualize the share of households with access to a certain asset at a subnational level. You may change access to bicycle to access to a computer or cellphone by using the filters provided. You may also switch to a different category of variables such as demographic or education variables. The filters allow the user to explore SARMD and learn what kind of data is available to study household welfare. Parts of the book This book provides the user of SARMD a complete understanding of the harmonization of variables in three main areas: Part 1 presents the metadata analysis of SARMD, which may be broadly described as an overview of the household survey questionnaires and other survey characteristics. This part studies the household surveys’ raw data, sampling methodology, coverage, data capturing methods, and ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures. Part 2 presents the harmonized variables in SARMD. The names of harmonized variables in this book are always emphasized as country, year, wgt, hsize, age, male, bicycle to help identify harmonized variables more easily. We inspect the quality of these harmonized variables and verify that each harmonized variable has been constructed properly. Two kinds of quality checks of the harmonized data have been conducted. A static quality check evaluates the coherence of each variable and its consistency with the rest of the variables in the dataset. At the individual level, for example, the variable age, which refers to the age of the individual, might be required to pass the following quality checks: It should not have negative values (internal coherence) age&gt;=0 All of its values should fall within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-120)1 0&lt;=age&lt;=120 The number of years of education of an individual educy should not be greater than age (internal consistency with other variables) educy&lt;age At the household level, for example, a high number of households that report having access to a television while not having access to electricity, that is, television==1 &amp; electricity==0, may raise questions on whether these variables were harmonized incorrectly or whether the inconsistency comes from the raw data. On the other hand, a dynamic quality check evaluates the inconsistencies in measurement of harmonized data and provides a better overview on whether categorical variables have changed over time. We tab the absolute and relative frequencies for the categories in categorical variables such as marital, urban, and educat7. In this section, it is also possible to see how the poverty dummy indicator used to generate extreme poverty headcounts, poor_int, changes over time. Part 3 presents a set of socioeconomic findings at the regional level using SARMD. Each of these analytical notes is a brief example of the potential analyses that may be conducted using SARMD. These examples provide the Stata code that may be used to replicate the results. That way, users become more familiar with SARMD and may use these pieces of code as starting points for their own projects. Even though it is possible to find in surveys people older than 120 years, it is not only unlikely, but also problematic for anonymization.↩ "],

Datalibweb is a data system specifically designed to enable users to access the most up-to-date versions of non-harmonized (original raw data) and harmonized datasets of different collections across Global Practices. SARMD is one collection among other collections available through datalibweb. This section provides reference to the documentation provided by the Global Team for Statistical Development (GTSD) in the Poverty and Equity Global Practice. Using the datalibweb system has several advantages: Instant access to raw and harmonized surveys ready to use for country or regional level analysis Automatically generated time-deflated variables and poverty lines User friendly interactive interface in Stata A suitable Stata command for replicability, research, and programing purposes Ability to combine different country surveys and survey years Merging raw data and modules of harmonized collections on the fly (option in progress) 2.1 Request access to the system Unlike GMD, access to regional harmonized collections like SARMD or to the original raw datasets is not given to users automatically. Most datasets in SARMD are not public and the user must be granted access for internal use. Each user must submit a request for the different collections and surveys specifying the purpose of the data request. Users must contact the regional/collection focal point and ask for permission to use the data. Without any subscription, users will only be able to check the availability of the data, and query relevant metadata of all surveys. To get access to SARMD, you may send an email to Francisco Javier Parada Gomez Urquiza and the datalibweb team specifying the following: Small description of the project in which you are planning to use the data Particular survey, country, year or collection that you are interested in accessing Who is the TTL in charge of the project Names and UPIs of the people who will be working directly with the data 2.2 Install the datalibweb command in Stata The datalibweb system can be accessed through the datalibweb Stata command. This command is already installed in all World Bank computers with an official Stata licence. In case it is not installed on your computer, you could do the following: Option 1. Direct Installation Close all Stata sessions Enter the following lines in Stata net from &quot;http://eca/povdata/datalibweb/_ado&quot;` net install datalibweb Option 2. Manual Installation Get the file from this link Copy with replacement all the files into c:/ado without changing the folder structure. 2.3 Filename structure All the data filenames in the SARMD repository follow the convention established by the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) for archiving and managing data. This structure can be generalized as follows: CCC_YYYY_SSSS_ vNN_M_vNN_A_TYPE_MODULE where, CCC refers to 3 letter ISO country code YYYY refers to survey year when data collection started SSSS refers to survey acronym (e.g., LSMS, CWIQ, HBS, etc.) vNN is the version vintage of the raw/master data if followed by an M or of the alternative/adapted data if followed by an A. The first version will always be v01, and when a newer version is available it should be named sequentially (e.g. v02, v03, etc.). Note that when a new version is available, the previous ones must still be kept. TYPE refers to the collection name. In the case of the South Asia region the user would refer to SARMD or, at the global level, to the GMD collection type. MODULE refers to the module of the collection. In the case of SARMD, it could be IND, which refers to the questions at the individual level, or FULL, which refers to the whole survey. For example, if the user wanted to load the most recent version of the harmonized Pakistani Household Survey of 2015, she would refer to the file PAK_2015_PSLM_v01_M_v02_A_SARMD_IND.dta. In this case, PSLM refers to the acronym of the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey. v01_M means that the version of the raw data has not changed since it is still the first. v02_A means that the most recent version of the harmonization is 02. 2.4 Using datalibweb Using datalibweb is straightforward. You may read the help file, which is detailed and clear, but you may also dive right in to get your data. There are two possible ways to access a dataset: Clicking on the Stata results window You may access the data by typing datalibweb in Stata and hitting Enter (see Figure 2.1). Then, click SAR on Stata’s results window and then click on the ISO code of your country of preference. Click PAK in this case. Then, select either the modules of the collection or its vintages next to SARMD. Finally, click 01-02, which refers to the version of the harmonization, to load the data. Figure 2.1: Accessing datalibweb in Stata Providing the complete datalibweb syntax Alternatively, a more efficient method when coding is to type the following to load your data: datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) vermast(01) veralt(02) survey(PSLM) clear Because there is only one survey for Pakistan in 2015 and you are interested in the most recent version, you could access that same dataset with a shorter version of the command: datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) clear Only when you request a previous version of the dataset or when there is more than one survey available for a country in a given year, you would need to specify the name of the survey and the version. Otherwise, you may just use the shorter command. 2.5 Citing datalibweb: datalibweb is a Stata program developed and supported by the Global Poverty Team for Statistical Development of the World Bank, with the contribution of many different teams: Stata front-end application: Minh Cong Nguyen, Raúl Andrés Castañeda Aguilar, José Montes, and João Pedro Azevedo, with support from Paul Andrés Corral Rodas.

["poverty-measures-in-south-asia.html", "Chapter 3 Poverty measures in South Asia Poverty and shared prosperity report PovcalNet", " Chapter 3 Poverty measures in South Asia The World Bank set a target of reducing extreme poverty to less than 3 percent by 2030 and to ensure continued focus and steady progress toward the goal, the institution set an interim target of 9 percent by 2020. Progress towards this goal is measured by monitoring the share of the global population living below the international poverty line, currently set at US$1.90 in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars. All eight countries in South Asia measure the international extreme poverty status of an individual by comparing consumption expenditures per capita against this poverty line. Even as much of the region leaves extreme poverty behind, poverty is becoming more entrenched and harder to root out in certain areas, particularly in countries burdened by violent conflict and weak institutions. Nepal experienced devastating earthquakes in 2015 and remains predominantly rural, with the highest share of labor force in agriculture (73%) in the region as of 2016. The Maldives were devastated by the 2004 tsunami while its tourism industry is seriously threatened by climate change. In the case of Afghanistan, poverty is increasing as violence continues to affect the security of livelihoods and economic activity in the country. In this chapter, we will present two World Bank sources for poverty measures: the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report and PovcalNet. Poverty and shared prosperity report According to the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018), the number of extreme poor in South Asia dropped to 216 million people in 2015, compared to half a billion in 1990, and Nigeria may already have overtaken India as the country with the most extreme poor in the world. Still, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, progress in poverty reduction needs to continue in India and the rest of South Asia. Figure 3.1 presents the latest extreme poverty headcounts available in the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report. Figure 3.1: Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018) The latest poverty measures from the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018) are also shown in Table 3.1: Table 3.1: Measures in Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report 2018 Country Survey year(s) Population Number of poor (millions) Poverty rate (%) Poverty gap (%) Poverty gap/rate (%) India 2011.5 1311.19 175.7 13.42 2.4 17.7 Bangladesh 2010 and 2016 160.53 24.4 15.16 2.8 18.1 Pakistan 2013.5 and 2015.5 190.38 9.9 5.23 0.7 13.2 Nepal 2010.17 28.57 2.0 7.03 1.4 19.8 Sri Lanka 2012.5 and 2016 25.00 0.2 0.77 0.1 11.7 Bhutan 2012 and 2017 0.81 0.0 1.66 0.3 16.3 Maldives 2009.5 0.37 0.0 4.08 0.8 20.3 Afghanistan NA 35.53 NA NA NA NA As expected, larger countries have a larger number of poor. However, note how Figure 3.2 clearly shows that Pakistan, which has a larger population than Bangladesh, proportionally has a smaller amount of extreme poor. Figure 3.2: South Asia region shares of poor and total population by country Based on the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018), we can provide the following highlights circa 2015: South Asia accounted for 29% of the people living in extreme poverty worldwide (216 million extreme poor in South Asia out of the estimated 736 million extreme poor worldwide). Four out of five extreme poor in the South Asia region resided in India. Despite a poverty rate of 13.42 percent, India’s large population of 1.3 billion results in a high absolute number of poor (175.7 million poor people). Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, but its large population still maintained it in second place within the region in terms of absolute number of poor (24.4 million extreme poor). The third place is Pakistan, which has a larger population than Bangladesh, but a smaller amount of extreme poor (9.9 million extreme poor). Pakistan has seen a consistent and significant decline in poverty over the 14 years from 2001 to 2015. Bhutan and Sri Lanka are considered development success stories where extreme poverty has become rare, although a large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the extreme poverty line. In the Maldives, extreme poverty is nearly nonexistent according to the latest survey data. PovcalNet PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows you to replicate the calculations made by the World Bank’s researchers in estimating the extent of absolute poverty in the world. The poverty and inequality measures provided by PovcalNet for South Asia are described in Table 3.2 and may be accessed by interacting with Figure 3.3: Figure 3.3: PovcalNet poverty and inequality measures Table 3.2: PovcalNet measures Measure Description Gini A measure of inequality between 0 (everyone has the same income) and 100 (richest person has all the income). Headcount % of population living in households with consumption per person below the poverty line. Mean Average monthly household per capita consumption expenditure from the survey in 2011 PPP. Median Median of monthly household per capita consumption expenditure from the survey in 2011 PPP. MLD Mean log deviation is an index of inequality, given by the mean across the population of the log of the overall mean divided by individual income. Population Country’s population in millions. Povgap The mean shortfall of income from the poverty line. The mean is based on the entire population treating the nonpoor as having a shortfall of zero, and the shortfall is expressed as a proportion of the poverty line. Povline Poverty line in 2011 PPP per day. The default poverty line is $1.90 per day. Squared The mean squared shortfall of income from the poverty line. The mean is based on the entire population treating the nonpoor as having a shortfall of zero, and the shortfall is expressed as a proportion of the poverty line (and then squared). Watts This is the mean across the population of the proportionate poverty gaps, as measured by the log of the ratio of the poverty line to income, where the mean is formed over the whole population, counting the nonpoor as having a zero poverty gap.

["poverty-measurement-methodology.html", "Chapter 4 Poverty measurement methodology", " Chapter 4 Poverty measurement methodology The starting point in monitoring progress in poverty reduction and enhancing shared prosperity in the region of South Asia is to have household consumption survey data that are not only available at reasonably frequent intervals, but are also comparable over time (Serajuddin et al. (2015)). Assuming we have computed comparable consumption expenditures at the household level, several spatial and temporal adjustments are necessary to take into account differences in costs of living across time and across countries. First, a consumer price index (CPI) is necessary to measure by how much the general price level in a country has changed over time. Deflating all nominal expenditures to real expenditures allows to ensure that welfare comparisons between two periods are not being driven by inflation. Figure 4.1 displays how the CPI has changed for each country in South Asia over time. Figure 4.1: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Second, spatial price differences, typically between urban and rural areas, can also be large and it is important to take them into account. In South Asia, price levels for rural households are often lower than for urban households. The ideal way to control for spatial differences in prices is to use a Paasche or Laspeyres index to account for differences in the cost of living across space. Third, it is necessary to convert expenditures to a common currency taking into account purchasing power. At present, data on purchasing power parity (PPP) comes from the International Comparison Program (ICP) collected in 2011, which is absent for Afghanistan. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalize the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. The PPP between countries A and B measures the number of units of country A’s currency required to purchase a basket of goods or services in country A as compared to one unit of country B’s currency to purchase a similar basket of goods in country B. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per US dollar and shown in the following table: Country Currency ICP 2011 Afghanistan Afghan afghani NA Bangladesh Bangladeshi taka 24.8493 Bhutan Bhutanese ngultrum 16.96292 India Indian rupee 13.98707 Maldives Maldivian rufiyaa 10.67606 Nepal Nepalese rupee 25.75928 Pakistan Pakistani rupee 25.41426 Sri Lanka Sri Lankan rupee 42.21894 A fourth adjustment is dividing total household expenditure by some measure of the number of people in the household, and to assign the resulting per capita welfare measure to each household member as an individual. Later in the applications, we show how larger households typically have lower per capita expenditure levels than smaller households. In South Asia, the consequences of dividing total household expenditures by a greater number of individuals would not be complete without considering the extent of economies of scale within the household and a discussion of how much children and the elderly typically consume compared to adults. The FGT measures devised by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) remain the most commonly used to measure poverty. A headcount ratio may be calculated in STATA as in the example below: * Example: Calculating poverty headcounts with 1.90 poverty line * Calculate per capita expenditures by dividing total * expenditures by the number of household members gen welfare=total_exp/hsize * Calculate real per capita expenditures by turning nominal * per capita expenditures into 2011 purchasing power parity * (PPP) dollars welfare_ppp = welfare/cpi2011/icp2011/365*12 * Generate a dummy variable to determine whether real per capita * expenditures fall below the 1.90 2011 PPP dollars poverty line gen poor190 = welfare_ppp &lt; 1.90 * Calculate the weighted average of the dummy variable to measure * the proportion of the population that falls below the 1.90 2011 * PPP dollars poverty line sum poor190 [aw=wgt] The variable welfare contains the monthly nominal expenditures per capita in local currency. Once turned into daily 2011 USD (PPP), these values may be compared over time and between countries as in Figure 4.2. The area to the left of the US$1.90 extreme poverty line represents the proportion of individuals living in extreme poverty.

Extreme data deprivation may be measured as having less than two data points in a ten-year period. The inventory section shows that in 2019 the region of South Asia is not considered extremely data deprived. Still, unless they collect surveys more frequently, three countries are vulnerable to extreme data deprivation by 2022: Bangladesh, Maldives and India. Figure 5.1 presents the current status of the SARMD harmonization process and its previous rounds for each country: Figure 5.1: Harmonization status of SARMD You may be wondering how does this compare to other regions of the world? Figures 5.2 and 5.3 provide the number of surveys that have been added to GMD over the last ten years. The answer is that compared to ECA and LAC where some countries even provide yearly updates, the rest of the developing world is very close to extreme data deprivation (dangerously close to less than two data points in a ten-year period). Note that we are omitting certain countries for which there are no surveys available. Therefore, we are overestimating these frequencies. The case of India is particularly important because the frequency of its poverty data is too low for a country with such an important role in global poverty monitoring. Its most recent survey conducted in 2016-17 has not been harmonized nor released yet. Figure 5.2: GMD inventory in the last 10 years (2008-2017) Figure 5.3: Number of surveys in GMD in the last 10 years (2008-2017) 5.1 Sample size As shown in Figure 5.4, India’s household survey is by far the largest in South Asia covering 100,000 households in the 2009 and 2011 rounds. Maldives’ survey is the smallest covering 4,910 households in the 2016 round. Most surveys have a stable sample size over time. A clear exception is Bangladesh 2016, which almost quadrupled its sample size compared to its predecessor in 2010. Household size is close to seven in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and much closer to 4-5 in the rest of the countries. Sri Lanka is the country with the smallest average household size. All surveys cover both urban and rural areas and the proportion of rural surveys can vary significantly. The latest Afghanistan and Sri Lanka surveys have collected a large proportion of surveys in rural households (above 80% of households). Figure 5.4: SARMD inventory 5.2 Country descriptions The content of these household surveys varies widely and their comparison over time even within the same country is a major challenge. We provide a brief overview of survey collection for each country below: 5.2.1 Afghanistan The Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey (ALCS) 2016-2017 represents the entire population of Afghanistan and may be disaggregated by urban and rural population, and by the nomadic Kuchi population. Previously, the survey was named National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA). This survey covers 35 strata, 34 for the provinces of Afghanistan and one for the nomadic Kuchi population. Stratification by season was achieved by equal distribution of data collection over 12 months within the provinces for the latest round between April 2016 and March 2017. In the first three months of fieldwork, areas that were inaccessible due to insecurity were replaced by sampled areas that were scheduled for a later month, in the hope that over time security conditions would improve. Eventually, some clusters in inaccessible areas were replaced by clusters that excluded insecure areas. The Central Statistics Organization (CSO) (http://cso.gov.af/) has used the ALCS 2016 to report that poverty rates in Afghanistan have experienced a sharp increase since 2011-12, especially in rural areas. Households of larger size face a higher poverty rate. Although larger land size is no guarantee for escaping poverty, the smaller the size of land owned by households, the higher is the proportion that falls below the poverty line. Lack of education is another important correlate of poverty in Afghanistan. Low levels of educational attainment are pervasive and households with illiterate heads account for 74 percent of the population. 5.2.2 Bangladesh The Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) is the comprehensive nationally representative survey used to measure poverty in Bangladesh. The HIES 2016/17 is the fourth round in the series of HIES conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) (http://bbs.gov.bd/) in 2000, 2005, and 2010. As of 2016, Bangladesh had eight administrative divisions. These were Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet. These 8 divisions of the country were stratified by rural, urban and city corporation, however, city corporations were only considered for Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi. This brought the number of strata to 20 (8 rural divisions, 8 urban divisions, and 4 city corporations). Based on the HIES 2016, the BBS reports that poverty was reduced substantially between 2010 and 2016. In 2010, the poverty headcount ratio, using a higher poverty line, was 31.5% which reduced to 24.3% in 2016. Using a lower poverty line, the headcount ratio also reduced from 17.6% in 2010 to 12.9% in 2016. Using the higher upper poverty line, Rangpur had the highest incidence of poverty at 47.2%, followed by Mymensingh 32.8%, Rajshahi 28.9% and Khulna 27.5%. On the other hand, Dhaka recorded the lowest headcount ratio of 16.0%, followed by Sylhet 16.2%, and Chittagong 18.4%. 5.2.3 Bhutan The Bhutan Living Standards Survey (BLSS) 2017 is the fourth in a series of living standards surveys undertaken by the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) (http://nsb.gov.bt). Earlier surveys were done in 2003, 2007, and 2012 to collect information on the demographics, education, health, employment, housing, access to services, asset ownership, credit, self-perceived poverty, and happiness of the population. The BLSS 2017 included 11,660 households with 48,639 individuals. The sample for BLSS 2017 was designed to provide estimates for many indicators on the living conditions of Bhutanese in both urban and rural areas of the twenty Dzongkhags, including the four Thromdes (Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar). The NSB reports a population poverty rate of 8.2% in 2017. The 2017 BLSS shows that the mean monthly household expenditure for the country is Nu33,542: Nu45,508 in urban areas, and Nu26,937 in rural areas. The mean monthly per capita household expenditure is Nu7,939. The monthly per capita household expenditure of Nu11,452 in urban areas is 85% higher than that in rural areas (Nu6,174). The mean per capita expenditure of households in the richest per capita consumption quintile of Nu17,802 is more than seven times that of households in the poorest per capita consumption quintile (Nu2,468). The NSB has also analyzed subjective happiness ratings by dzongkhags. Pema Gatshel is the happiest Dzongkhag (94%) followed by Samtse (more than 88%) and Trongsa Dzongkhags (more than 86%). The exception is Dagana Dzongkhag, where only four in every 10 respondents reported they are happy. Dagana also stands out as the Dzongkhag with the highest poverty rate. 5.2.4 India Despite India’s remarkable progress in reducing poverty, poverty remains widespread especially in the highly-populated Eastern states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh. The national poverty estimates for India are based on rounds of Household Consumption Expenditure Surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) (http://mospi.gov.in/). The 68th round (July 2011-June 2012) of NSS is designated to measure household consumer expenditure, employment, and unemployment. The 68th round is the most recent round for which consumption data is currently available in SARMD. The survey covers the whole of the Indian Union except interior villages of Nagaland situated beyond five kilometers of the bus route and villages in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which remain inaccessible throughout the year. In the 68th round two schedule types exist. The two schedule types differ by their reference periods (in the 68th round, Schedule Type 1 and Schedule Type 2 use the same reference periods as in the 66th round). Sample households were divided into two sets: Schedule Type 1 was canvassed in one set and Schedule Type 2 in the other. Schedule Type 1 requires that for certain non-food items (clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods), the same household should report data for two reference periods: the last 30 days and the last 365 days. For these same non-food items, the reference period used in Schedule Type 2 is only the last 365 days. As in the 66th round, items of food, pan, tobacco and intoxicants (food-plus category) are split into 2 blocks, block 5.1 and block 5.2, instead of being placed in a single block. Block 5.1 consists of cereals, pulses, milk and milk products, sugar and salt. This block has a reference period of 30 days in both Schedule Type 1 and Schedule Type 2. Block 5.2 consists of the other items of food, along with pan, tobacco and intoxicants. This block is assigned a reference period of last 30 days in Schedule Type 1 and a reference period of last 7 days in Schedule Type 2. The 75th round of the National Sample Survey conducted in July 2017-June 2018 is expected to be released in 2019. It covers Household Consumer Expenditure, Household Social Consumption, and Education. Its design is similar to Schedule 1.0 Type 2 in NSS 68th Round, i.e., with Modified Mixed Reference Period (MMRP). Even though the data has not been released yet, the questionnaires are available at http://mospi.nic.in/schedule-instructions. 5.2.5 Maldives The latest round of the Maldives Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) took place in 2016 with other rounds conducted in 2003 and 2009-10. The sample (4,910 households and 26,453 individuals) was designed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) (http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/) in such a way that the results are representative for each of the 20 individual atolls and the capital Male’. The HIES 2016 questionnaire was completely revised and includes important survey improvements, particularly in the measurement of poverty, which also hinders comparability with past survey years (Wieser, Vecchi, and Mancini (2018)). Improvements include the inclusion of rent and durable goods in the construction of the welfare aggregate, and change from diary to recall of food items. According to the national poverty line, the poverty is highest in Gdh. atoll and the lowest is in V. atoll. The Gini coefficient for Maldives is 0.313, and is slightly higher in Male’ than in the Atolls. 5.2.6 Nepal National poverty estimates in Nepal are produced by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) (http://cbs.gov.np/). The last national poverty update in Nepal was based on the 2010 Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS-III). Three rounds of the Nepal Living Standards Surveys (NLSS) have been carried out in 1995/96, 2003/04, and 2010/11. These surveys follow the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Survey methodology and cover a wide range of topics: demography, consumption, income, access to facilities, housing, education, health, employment, credit, remittances, etc. While the data from the next round of the NLSS is unlikely to be available until the end of 2019, the CBS has conducted five rounds of the Annual Household Survey (AHS) from 2012-13 to 2016-17. Before the release of the next national poverty rate estimates from NLSS-IV, the World Bank plans to prepare the poverty update report using the recent AHS. The new administrative division of Nepal consists of seven provinces, some of which have not been named yet. These seven provinces are currently referred as Province No. 1, Province No. 2, Province No. 3, Gandaki, Province No. 5, Karnali, and Sudurpashchim. This new administrative division of Nepal was implemented with the new constitution on September 20, 2015. Before 2015, instead of provinces, Nepal was divided into developmental regions and administrative zones. 5.2.7 Pakistan The latest round of the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) 2015-2016 conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) (http://www.pbs.gov.pk/) covers 24,238 households. It provides information on household income, savings, liabilities, consumption expenditures, and consumption patterns at national and provincial levels. Before this survey, six rounds were conducted during 2004-05, 2005-06, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2013-14. The PSLM covers all urban and rural areas of the four provinces of Pakistan (Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan) excluding Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and military restricted areas. The incidence of poverty is uneven across Pakistan’s provinces. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the province with the lowest poverty headcount in 2015, while Balochistan accounts for the highest poverty rate. As in the rest of the region, poverty is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. 5.2.8 Sri Lanka The Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) (http://www.statistics.gov.lk/) is the main data source used to calculate poverty indices for Sri Lanka. The HIES 2016 is the ninth in the HIES series and was conducted in January-December 2016. SARMD also contains four of the previous rounds conducted in 2002, 2006, 2009, and 2012. THE HIES covers all 9 provinces (Central Province, Eastern Province, North Central Province, Northern Province, North Western Province, Sabaragamuwa, Southern Province, Uva, and Western Province) and 25 districts in the country. The survey provides information on household income and consumption expenditure to measure changes in living conditions. According to the DCS, the poverty headcount ratio declined from 6.7% in 2012/13 to 4.1% in 2016. Despite progress, pockets of deep poverty remain in the North and the East. Among the districts, Kilinochchi district reported the highest headcount index (18.2%) and Colombo had the lowest (0.9%). References "],
["expenditure-components.html", "Chapter 6 Expenditure components 6.1 Food 6.2 Non-food 6.3 Durable assets 6.4 Housing", " Chapter 6 Expenditure components In this chapter, we present a metadata analysis focusing on the household surveys’ ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures through different data collection methods. The characteristics of each household survey and their ability to construct a nominal consumption aggregate were collected by filling a metadata formulary.2 This metadata collection tool may be accessed in the folder metadata_collection_tool. We provide an empty formulary and an example of a filled out formulary that you may use as reference. See “SAR_PAK_2015 (Example).xlsm”. You must keep the filled out formularies in the same folder where you also keep the file “consumption surveys metadata.xlsx”. Once you have filled out the information for a formulary, click on the Submit button. This will record all of the content of your formulary as a new row in “consumption surveys metadata.xlsx”. The Stata metaform.ado program transforms “consumption surveys metadata.xlsx” into a shape to be used in Tableau. 6.1 Food The first component is food expenditures, which should include not only food produced and/or consumed at home, but also food purchases outside of home, and food transfers to and from the household. This component is sometimes thought to be easier to measure than non-food items. When household members eat from a common pot, it is common to find a single well-informed individual who can act as respondent and provide information about how much the household has consumed. Household surveys sometimes include a food expenditure diary, but this is not common in South Asia where most information on food is collected based on recalling what a household has consumed and purchased over the last seven days. The ideal reference period should be a week, but in this analysis we have found reference periods still vary from yearly, to monthly, to biweekly, to daily across surveys. In recent years, the Indian National Sample Survey Organization has experimented with 7-day and 30-day recall periods for a number of items, and discovered that the 7-day recall cuts Indian poverty rates by half, removing some 200 million people from dollar-a-day poverty. This is an issue that has not been much investigated, but has recently moved into the forefront of research. In other words, methods matter and it is important to standardize data collection as much as possible. In most cases, countries modify their food baskets and change their data collection methods over time. A wide mixture of data collection methods characterizes the most recent rounds of household surveys. Bangladesh HIES 2016 collects daily household food consumption (both quantity and value) for a period of 14 days. In addition, it collects weekly consumption of a series of spices. Bhutan LSS 2017 collects food consumption (both quantity and value) by asking the respondent to recall their consumption in the last seven days, the last thirty days, and the last year. In some cases, such as Afghanistan LCS 2016, the female respondents are the ones asked about household food consumption. These methods can be very diverse and we provide a brief description for the latest survey available for each country in Table 6.1. Table 6.1: Mixture of collection methods for food at home Country, Year Number of food items Collection method Quantity and/or Value Afghanistan, 2016 92 Recall (weekly) Quantity Bangladesh, 2016 151 Diary (daily) Both Bhutan, 2017 115 Recall (weekly, monthly, yearly) Both India, 2011 134 Recall (multiple) Both Maldives, 2016 146 Recall (weekly) Both Nepal, 2015 97 Recall (weekly) Both Pakistan, 2015 170 Recal (biweekly) Both Sri Lanka, 2016 198 Recall (weekly) Both Food is composed of all edible goods that are purchased and consumed by the household with the purpose of nourishing. Food baskets are usually organized by categories into: Cereals and cereal products; Meat; Fish and other seafood; Milk, other dairy products and eggs; Oils and fats; Fruit and nuts; Vegetables, tubers, plantains, cooking bananas and pulses; Sugar, confectionery and desserts; Salt, sauces and condiments, spices and culinary herbs and seeds. Alcohol and tobacco are considered non-food items for measuring purposes, but it is common to find them in the food section of a questionnaire. In most surveys, households report both quantities and expenditures for most of the foods they purchase (e.g. three kilograms of rice for 5 rupees). However, this is not the norm. For example, Afghanistan LCS 2016 asks what was the amount of 92 items used in the last seven days, but the price of each item is collected separately through a market price survey. Besides food produced and consumed at home, the food component should include food consumed outside the home, both formally such as at restaurants and cafés, and informally, such as small snacks and drinks. This component is usually recorded separately and is more likely to suffer from measurement error. An agreement on how these expenditures should be recorded has not been reached. For example, Afghanistan LCS 2016 asks for the total amount spent on food and drinks outside of home in the last month. In contrast, Bhutan LSS 2017 asks how many times did the household consume food for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack, outside of home in the last 7 days and what was the average value of the purchase. Another component that is prone to measurement error is food transfers, which are currently measured unevenly with different collection methods. We have found that it is more common to find questions regarding transfers to the household than transfers from the household to other households. For example, Bhutan LSS 2017 asks what is the total value of a food item that was received as gift over the past 12 months. However, it does not ask what amount of the food item the household has transferred to others. We provide a Tableau dashboard where the user may compare surveys according to: The number of food items in the food basket Whether they collect the quantity and/or value of food consumed at home and outside of home Data collection methods (diary vs. recall) as well as their reference periods (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and/or yearly) Information on self-production Information on transfers to and from the household Instructions: The user may interact with this dashboard by filtering the observations. Try selecting Bangladhesh in the bottom panel. This will filter the data in order to show only the characteristics of the surveys in Bangladesh. The same is possible by selecting a single question, a single answer to a question, a single year, etc. Figure 6.1: Food expenditure 6.2 Non-food The second component, non-food expenditures, includes frequently purchased goods and services like soap, cleaning supplies, newspapers, and personal care items. It also includes some less frequent but regular purchases like clothing, footwear, kitchen equipment, curtains, bedcovers, etc. In most cases, the non-food expenditures component must be constructed by aggregating expenditures on goods and services from different sections of a survey. A homogenous definition of what constitutes non-food expenditures is required. The Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) is the international reference classification for household expenditures. We define non-food expenditures as categories 2-12 of the COICOP: Food and non-alcoholic beverages Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics Clothing and footwear Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels Furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance Health Transport Information and communication Recreation, sport and culture Education services Restaurants and hotels Miscellaneous goods and services Still, each country may determine its own definition of what constitutes non-food expenditures. In Bangladesh 2016, non-food expenditures included fuel and lightning, cosmetics and hygiene items, transport and travel, ready-made garments, clothing materials, footwear, household-use textiles, health treatment expenses, housing related expenses, education, recreation and leisure. In Bhutan 2017, non-food expenditures included tobacco and doma, clothing and footwear, transport and communications, household operations, recreation, furnishings and household equipment, agricultural input and machinery, miscellaneous expenditure, educational expenses, health expenses, rental expenses, energy for the home, and remittances abroad. Similarly to what found studying the food component, non-food items are also collected for different reference periods, for example, from consumption in the last 30 days, past 3 months, or the last year. Monthly is the most frequent collection period for non-food expenditures. Both food and non-food expenditures have insufficient coverage on transfers. We provide a Tableau Dashboard where the user may compare surveys according to: The number of non-food items in the non-food basket Whether they collect the quantity and/or value of non-food items Data collection reference periods (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and/or yearly) Whether they provide information on transfers to and from the household Instructions: The user may interact with this dashboard by filtering the observations. Try selecting Bangladhesh in the bottom panel. This will filter the data in order to show only the characteristics of the surveys in Bangladesh. The same is possible by selecting a single question, a single answer to a question, a single year, etc. Figure 6.2: Non-food expenditure 6.3 Durable assets The third component is consumer flows from durable assets. The consumer flows from durable assets (also referred to as user costs or rental equivalents) represent the opportunity cost of money invested in these goods taking into account their lifetime and depreciation. The most important finding regarding the collection of data on durable assets through household surveys in South Asia is that the data collection methods followed can be very different. It is expected for data collection methods to vary over time and from one country to another. However, even for items within a country’s particular survey we can find different data collection methods. For example, even though both cows and cars may be considered productive assets, the information available for these two assets within a survey may be very different and would be contained in different sections of the survey. Even for more similar goods, like a washing machine and a sewing machine, the information provided by a survey may differ. For that reason, we found it necessary to characterize each item’s data collection method separately. Data available for household assets (e.g. a car) may be different from data available for agricultural assets (e.g. a tractor). Some assets are grouped together, while others are collected individually, and some may even have their own section in the survey. This is the case for cellphones, which are durable assets, but are usually given special treatment and collected separately in the surveys. Long-lived goods (automobiles, appliances, furniture) have a positive and significant impact on living standards. These durable assets may deliver useful services to consumers through repeated use over an extended period of time. For that reason, surveys should collect data on all assets available to the household, not just the ones purchased recently. This is unfortunately the case for India 2011 and Pakistan 2015. Pakistan 2015 collects information on durable assets only if they were purchased in the last year. India 2011 collects specific details only for assets acquired in the last 30 days or in the last year. To measure the flows from using durable goods over extended periods of time, we need to know their quantity, date of purchase, and how much they cost at the time of purchase vs. their current value. Nepal AHS 2016 represents the standard practice a survey should follow. Nepal AHS 2016 asks whether the assets are available, their quantity, age, purchase and current values, and whether the assets were paid for or received as gift. Asking how many years ago was an asset acquired provides more information than asking whether the asset was purchased in the last 12 months. The most incomplete example would have to be Pakistan 2015, which focuses only on assets acquired in the last year and only measures values, not quantities. Table 6.2 provides a quick comparison between countries by presenting the number of assets collected, and their collection method (i.e. quantity and/or value). In addition, we provide a Tableau dashboard where the user may identify which surveys collect insufficient information regarding durable assets. Table 6.2: Durables Country, Year Number of assets Quantity Value Afghanistan, 2016 18 7 Yes Yes Yes Yes Bangladesh, 2016 27 Yes Yes Bhutan, 2017 13 9 23 No Yes Yes No No Yes India, 2011 53 Yes, but only if recently purchased Yes, but only if recently purchased Maldives, 2016 16 Yes Yes Nepal, 2016 23 Yes Yes Pakistan, 2015 67 No Yes, but only if recently purchased Sri Lanka, 2016 25 Yes Yes Instructions: The user may interact with this dashboard by filtering the observations. Try selecting Bangladhesh in the bottom panel. This will filter the data in order to show only the characteristics of the surveys in Bangladesh. The same is possible by selecting a single question, a single answer to a question, a single year, etc. Figure 6.3: Durables assets expenditure 6.4 Housing The fourth component is rent, which is in some cases observed directly for households who rent their house or apartment. For the rest, rent is obtained either by asking a household how much they would expect to receive each month for this house if they rented it out to someone, or by using a hedonic housing regression model based on dwelling characteristics and actual rent or house values. Therefore, there are three types of rent: Rent paid by households when they are not owners of their dwelling: i.e. How much do you pay per month? Self-reported or imputed rent by households who are owners of their dwelling: i.e. How much do you think you would have to pay if you had to rent this dwelling? Predicted rent by households who are owners of their dwelling and did not self-report their rent: i.e. How much does the hedonic regression model predict a household would have to pay for a dwelling of these characteristics? Most households in South Asia do not report values on paid rent because most households are owners of housing rather than renters. One area of South Asia where we find low levels of house ownership is Thimphu in Bhutan. According to Bhutan LSS 2017, in Thimphu, 59% of the households pay rent, while 17% of households live in rent-free dwellings. Of rent-paying households, 85% live in dwellings owned by private individuals and 14% live in housing owned by the government and by public corporations. The methodologies for a hedonic regression model vary by country. The methodology followed by Afghanistan differs from the rest of the countries in that they base their hedonic pricing model on the dwelling’s values and then convert it to a monthly rent, instead of trying to directly estimate rents. In Afghanistan, actual rent for renters is collected by asking “How much money per month does your household pay to live in this dwelling?”. However, there is a low number of renters. Self-reported rent was not included in the survey. Instead, rents are predicted by a hedonic regression model. Half of all owners in the LCS 2016 report the value of their dwelling by answering “If you were to purchase this dwelling today, how much would it cost?”. For these households, a hedonic housing model is estimated and used to predict the value of the dwelling based on the characteristics of the dwelling. A hedonic housing model relates the housing price to factors such as size, location, construction materials, etc. Separate regressions are estimated for urban, rural and tent dwellings. The actual or predicted housing values are converted to a monthly rent by imposing a relationship based on interest and depreciation rates. For ALCS 2016 a depreciation rate of 1.5 percent and an interest rate of 2.5 percent are assumed. For Bangladesh HIES 2016, the housing expenditure component may include the three types or rent depending on the homeownership status of each of the households: actual rent, imputed rent (i.e., the amount that homeowners report they would like to get if they could rent their house) or predicted rent. For households that did not report rent or self-report their rent, a predicted rent was estimated using a hedonic regression model. This regression model was estimated using the (log of) reported rent on the left-hand side and was regressed against a set of housing characteristics, including number of rooms, wall materials, access to electricity and tap water, kitchen, dining room, telephone connection, dwelling’s land size, and a vector of the 16 original strata dummy variables. The value of dwellings was collected by asking “If you want to buy or construct a dwelling just like this today, how much money would you have to pay?”, but it is not clear whether this value was used in the hedonic regression model. In the rest of the countries, households are asked for their hypothetical rental values, not for the value of their dwelling. Table 6.3 summarizes how each survey collects rent or dwelling values for households who own their dwelling. For Bhutan LSS 2017, households were asked for the amount of rent they pay for their dwelling in a month. People who own their dwelling or stay in rent-free houses were asked to estimate the monthly house rent for their dwellings. The question was “How much would you pay if you had to rent this dwelling?”. A similar question is included in the surveys Maldives HIES 2016, Nepal AHS 2016 and Sri Lanka HIES 2016. India 2011 and Pakistan 2015 still lack enough data to measure rents. Table 6.3: Housing Country, Year How is rent calculated for owners? Afghanistan, 2016 If you were to purchase this dwelling, how much would it cost? Bangladesh, 2016 Imputed rent; also asks If you want to buy or construct a dwelling just like this today, how much money would you have to pay? Bhutan, 2017 How much do you think you would have to pay if you had to rent this dwelling? India, 2011 NA Maldives, 2016 How much would you expect to receive each month for this house if you rented it out to someone?

The different colors indicate a variable’s percentage of missing values. Figure 7.2: SARMD Availability and missing observations 7.1 Basic survey characteristics Figure 7.3: Basic survey characteristics The essential variables that identify each dataset and individual within a household are countrycode, year, survey, vermast, veralt, idh, and idp. Weights are defined as wgt and pop_wgt=wgtxhsize. The dates of the survey are recorded as int_year and int_month. The geographical location within the country’s administrative division is recorded as subnatid1, and in some cases, subnatid2 may provide a more specific location. Unfortunately, the variables psu and strata are only available for a few surveys.

The oldest is Sri Lanka. 7.2.2 hsize Household size is close to seven in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Maldives, and much closer to 4-5 in the rest of the countries. The following dashboard shows how average household size declines as we move to higher quintiles of per capita expenditures. Average household size is 9.66 in the poorest per capita expenditure quintile of Afghanistan, compared to 3.91 in the richest per capita expenditure quintile of Sri Lanka. Having more children (individuals &lt; 15 years old) is negatively correlated with household per capita expenditures. We would expect higher poverty rates among large households and households with more children. 7.2.3 male Sex ratio is used to describe the number of females per 1000 of males. In India, and some other countries in South Asia, this ratio may be heavily skewed towards men. 7.2.4 relationcs This variable refers to the original categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head. They change from survey to survey and may include categories as: Household Head Husband/Wife Son/Daughter Grandchildren Grandfather/Grandmother Father or mother Father-in-law/Mother-in-law Brother or sister Brother-in-law/sister-in-law Nephew or niece Domestic servants Employee Other family relative Unrelated member 7.2.5 relationharm This variable refers to the simplified categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head: Household Head Spouse Children Parents Other relatives Non-relatives 7.2.6 marital This variable classifies individuals according to their marital status into these simplified categories: Never Married Married Divorced/separated Widowed Living Together Population pyramids such as the one provided in Figure 7.4 allow to see how countries’ demographics change over time while showing whether the marital status of individuals has been harmonized adequately. About 63.7 percent of Afghans are under 25 years of age, reflecting a steep pyramid age structure. Figure 7.4: Population pyramids 7.3 Education There are currently eight essential education variables in SARMD: literacy, atschool, everattend, ed_mod_age, educy, educat4, educat5, and educat7. 7.3.1 literacy The adult literacy rate – referring to the population aged 15 and over – is an indicator that measures the accumulated achievement of the education system. The youth literacy rate – the literacy rate in the population aged 15-24 – reflects the outcomes of primary education over roughly the previous 10 years and is a measure of recent educational progress. 7.3.2 atschool Dummy variable that indicates whether individual is currently enrolled in school. 7.3.3 everattend Dummy variable that indicates whether individual has ever attended school. 7.3.4 ed_mod_age Minimum age level at which the education module of the questionnaire is applied. 7.3.5 educy Number of years of education of an individual. Should not include pre-school. 7.3.6 educat4 Education categories divided into four groups. 7.3.7 educat5 Education categories divided into five groups. 7.3.8 educat7 Education categories divided into seven groups. 7.4 Durable assets This section analyzes whether the sixteen asset variables in SARMD have been adequately harmonized and may be used for research purposes. These binary variables (Yes=1, No=0) represent whether households have access to a particular durable asset. The variables are defined at the household level and do not represent whether each individual owns an asset in particular, but whether the household as a whole has access to it. The harmonization of these asset variables is limited by their availability in the household questionnaire. For example, cow, chicken, and buffalo cannot be harmonized if a survey does not cover live-stocking activities. It may also be that some of these assets are unnecessary (a fan in cold weather), obsolete (land phone), or too basic (lamp) to be included in a questionnaire. Quality checks were conducted to make sure that these variables could only be equal to 0 or 1. We also verified that the value was the same within each household. A deeper look at these asset variables allowed to identify some interesting trends. Figure 7.5 displays the percentage of households that have access to an asset by country for the latest survey round available. It shows that cellphones are the most accessible assets and that there can be a wide range between the minimum and the maximum. Figure 7.5: Harmonized asset ownership in latest household survey round see Figure 7.5 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Assets Figure 7.6: Access to refrigerator and access to electricity across surveys see Figure 7.6 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Scatter Figure 7.6 shows a clear exponential trend between the percentage of households that have access to electricity and the percentage of households that have access to a refrigerator. A similar relationship with electricity was found for television, washing machine, and fan. A quality check was conducted to identify the number of observations where the household had no access to electricity, but still had access to an asset. In some cases, it might seem illogical, for example, for a household to own a television if it does not have access to electricity. In Afghanistan (2013), 7,771 out of 20,773 households seemed to have a television and no electricity. However, a mistake in the harmonization process was identified and this number was reduced to 3,119 out of 20,773 households once the mistake was fixed. Still, 13-20% of observations in Afghanistan have consistently reported having a television and no electricity. 7.4.1 bicycle 7.4.2 buffalo 7.4.3 cellphone 7.4.4 chicken 7.4.5 computer 7.4.6 cow 7.4.7 fan 7.4.8 lamp 7.4.9 landphone 7.4.10 motorcar 7.4.11 motorcycle 7.4.12 radio 7.4.13 refrigerator 7.4.14 sewingmachine 7.4.15 television 7.4.16 washingmachine 7.5 Housing The living conditions of the Afghan population are to a large extent determined by the conditions of housing, including facilities for drinking water and sanitation. Most people – 83 percent – live in dwellings that are constructed with non-durable materials and 44 percent live in conditions of overcrowding, meaning that there are more than three persons per room.

["welfare-and-access-to-durable-assets-in-south-asia.html", "Chapter 11 Welfare and access to durable assets in South Asia", " Chapter 11 Welfare and access to durable assets in South Asia Abstract: Economic inequality may cover a wide variety of topics, most commonly, the distribution of income, expenditures, and wealth. In this analysis, we study the unequal distribution of durable assets between different groups in South Asia. We find that the cumulative percentage of access to assets by expenditures per capita rarely behaves as a flat line, which means access to assets is unequal. We find access to most assets has increased rapidly in South Asia, although unevenly for different levels of welfare. A few exceptions are assets that may be becoming obsolete, such as radios and land phones, for which access has decreased over time across the region for all levels of welfare. For most assets, including energy-using assets such as refrigerators and televisions, we see a positive relationship between access and expenditures per capita as expected. In contrast, assets may become less accessible in some cases as households become richer (for example, bicycles), suggesting they may have the characteristics of inferior goods. Energy-using appliances, such as refrigerators, are taken for granted among households in developed countries. However, in South Asia these assets are still scarce and owning a refrigerator, for example, can have important consequences on the well-being of a family. Refrigerators may be common in urban areas of New Delhi, but they are almost non-existent in central Afghanistan. We study how access to assets increases with welfare with the help of harmonized data from SARMD. The possession of valuable assets that facilitate family labor in a meaningful way are quick indicators of household purchasing power and economic development in the region. In microeconomics, an Engel curve describes how household expenditure on a good or service varies with households’ purchasing power. For normal goods, the Engel curve has a positive gradient. That is, as purchasing power increases, the quantity of assets demanded increases. For inferior goods, the Engel curve has a negative gradient. Both Engel curves in Figure 11.1 are upward sloping, but one bends toward the X-axis for necessities and the other towards the Y-axis for luxury goods. Figure 11.1: Engel curves for normal goods The harmonized asset variables in SARMD indicate, not the quantity demanded, but whether households have access to assets. For example: Variable Description bicycle Household has access to a bicycle (1 = Yes 0 = No) cellphone Household has access to a cellphone (1 = Yes 0 = No) computer Household has access to a computer (1 = Yes 0 = No) landphone Household has access to a landphone (1 = Yes 0 = No) motorcar Household has access to a motorcar (1 = Yes 0 = No) motorcycle Household has access to a motorcycle (1 = Yes 0 = No) radio Household has access to a radio (1 = Yes 0 = No) refrigerator Household has access to a refrigerator (1 = Yes 0 = No) sewingmachine Household has access to a sewing machine (1 = Yes 0 = No) television Household has access to a television (1 = Yes 0 = No) washingmachine Household has access to a washing machine (1 = Yes 0 = No) Therefore, we do not know the quantity of assets demanded by each household and we are not able to present an Engel curve as described above. However, we may calculate the percentage of households with access to assets as shown in Figure 11.2. Access to assets like motorcars and computers is low on average in all of the surveys in SARMD, while access to cellphones and televisions may be low or high depending on the survey and year. Note that there is not a single asset for which access was high across all surveys. Figure 11.2: Access to assets by survey As more households currently living in poverty benefit from overall economic development, we would expect a considerable increase in households’ purchases of durable assets and energy use. An estimated 368 million people live without electricity in their homes in South Asia, and even among those who do have access, many do not own basic assets such as refrigerators, televisions, or washing machines. C. Wolfram, Shelef, and Gertler (2012) estimate the impact of increasing access to energy-using assets. According to their estimates, if one half of the households in India who do not own refrigerators were to buy one, annual nationwide electricity demand would rise by over 10 percent. Figure 11.3 displays the wide gap that exists between countries in the percentage of households with access to these assets. For example, almost every household in the Maldives has access to a refrigerator, while access to a refrigerator is lower in the rest of the countries. The user may use the filters to display the same figure for different durable assets. Figure 11.3: Assets to assets over time We model the non-linear relationship between welfare and access to assets as in P. J. Gertler et al. (2016). These authors provide a theoretical framework to characterize the effect of income growth on asset purchases when consumers face credit constraints. A non-linear Engel curve means that as income goes up from initially very low levels, credit-constrained households do not immediately become more likely to purchase assets. Households faced with credit constraints only become likely to purchase assets once their income passes certain threshold levels. Figure 11.4 presents the cumulative percentage of access to assets by expenditures per capita. A horizontal line would represent perfect equality in asset distribution, but that is rarely the case in the figures below. These figures show how unequal is the distribution of access to assets. In some cases, as in P. J. Gertler et al. (2016), we find an S-shaped relationship between households’ per capita expenditures and access to durable assets. Figure 11.4: Cumulative access to assets by expenditures per capita We provide some highlights from this analysis for each of the assets: Table 11.1: Access to assets and welfare Asset Results Bicycle A negative slope may suggest bicycles are an inferior good, that is, it is more common for poor households to have access to them. Cellphone We see a quick increase in access to cellphones over time at all levels of welfare. Computer Access to computers only increases at levels of welfare above the poverty lines. Electricity Access to electricity is clearly lower for individuals below the 1.90 poverty line. Ever attend school This variable is technically not an asset, but we decided to include in this analysis. We can see positive slopes in every country, that is, poorer individuals are more likely to answer they have never attended any school. Fan Having access to a fan is clearly related to welfare. Richer individuals may afford this luxury and may also be the only ones with access to electricity to be able to use a fan. Land phone Having access to a land phone is clearly becoming obsolete, especially compared to the levels of access to cellphones. Literacy Literacy is increasing over time and still related to welfare. Illiteracy is clearly more common among the poorest individuals. Motorcar Having access to a motorcar seems to be more common for rich individuals in Afghanistan and Bhutan. Motorcycle Having access to a motorcycle is more common than having access to a motorcar. Having access to motorcycles has become more frequent over time, especially among richer individuals. Own house Compared to other assets, most households own the house they live in. Renting is common only among richer households in urban areas. Piped water Only Bhutan shows having almost universal access to piped water. Radio Another good that may be becoming obsolete are radios, with less households reporting having access to a radio over time at all levels of welfare. Refrigerator Having access to a refrigerator seems to be strongly related to welfare, with average access to it growing fast around the 3.2 poverty line. Sewage toilet No country shows evidence of high access to sewage toilets. Sewing machine Sewing machines seem to remain highly valuable in Afghanistan and Pakistan with more than 50% of individuals reporting having access to it. Television Televisions are a highly-desirable durable asset and are clearly more common among richer households. Having access to a television depends on having access to electricity. Both electricity and television follow similar trends. Washing machine Having access to a washing machine is clearly a luxury and only common among the wealthiest.

["school-enrollment-in-south-asia.html", "Chapter 12 School enrollment in South Asia Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India Maldives Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka ", " Chapter 12 School enrollment in South Asia Abstract: Countries in South Asia have achieved different levels of progress regarding school enrollment at different educational stages (pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary). We study how school enrollment of school-age children and young adults (age&lt;25) changes over time in each country depending on gender and location (urban/rural). School enrollment over age is flat for children in primary school and resembles a trapezoid in countries that have achieved almost universal primary education such as Maldives, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. However, school enrollment still has the shape of an inverted U in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, where dropout rates are concerning even among primary school children aged 4 to 12 years. In recent years, South Asian countries have invested in school inputs and directed their efforts towards achieving universal access to primary education. These investments have led to more children retained in primary school. According to Dundar et al. (2014), enrollment in South Asia’s primary schools rose from 75 percent in 2000 to 89 percent in 2010, bringing it closer to enrollment levels in Latin America and the Caribbean (94 percent) and East Asia and the Pacific (94.8 percent). Between 1999 and 2010, the number of out-of-school children ages 8–14 years fell from 35 million to 13 million, and the number of out-of-school girls in the region dropped by 59 percent. Progress at other educational stages has not been as consistent and is harder to measure. Early childhood education (kindergarden and preschool) provides foundations for young children to develop skills that can help them succeed in school and over the course of their lives. Still, according to UNICEF (2019), more than 35 million children in South Asia are not attending age appropriate pre-primary education. In the area of tertiary or higher education there is a wide difference among countries. According to Tilak (2015), India has one of the largest systems of higher education in the world, with about 21 million students enrolled in nearly 700 universities and 40 thousand colleges. Bangladesh and Pakistan stand at distant second and third positions, with two million and 1.8 million students in higher education respectively. In contrast, student numbers are very small in value in Sri Lanka and Nepal. Bhutan has only one university and Maldives does not have any. In this analysis, we compare the education levels achieved across countries considering their different education systems. Sustainable Development Goal 4 has ten targets encompassing many different aspects of education. The first target is to ensure that by 2030 all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes. Equality in primary education between girls and boys has improved, but not at all levels of education. Sri Lanka achieved near-universal primary education between girls and boys decades ago, while Afghanistan and Pakistan still lag significantly behind other South Asian countries. The South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD) contains the following harmonized variables at the individual level (when age&gt;=ed_mod_age) to monitor progress towards the achievement of these goals: Variable Description ed_mod_age Age at which education module is applied atschool Individual attending school (1 = Yes 0 = No) everattend Individual ever attended school (1 = Yes 0 = No) literacy Individual can read and write (1 = Yes 0 = No) educy Years of education educat4 1 = No education 2 = Primary (complete or incomplete) 3 = Secondary (complete or incomplete) 4 = Tertiary (complete or incomplete) educat5 1 = No education 2 = Primary incomplete 3 = Primary complete but secondary incomplete 4 = Secondary complete 5 = Some tertiary educat7 1 = No education 2 = Primary incomplete 3 = Primary complete 4 = Secondary incomplete 5 = Secondary complete 6 = Higher than secondary but not university 7 = University incomplete or complete The most vulnerable group in terms of low literacy is women older than 65 years. Even among younger adults and children, the difference in literacy rates between men and women is wide. Figure 12.1 displays average literacy rates at a subnational level. Afghanistan clearly stands out being one of the countries with the lowest literacy rates in the world. In 2011, it was estimated at about 31 percent of the adult population (15 years or older). Figure 12.1: Literacy rates at subnational level Primary, secondary and tertiary education are defined differently in each country, but may be summarized as in Figure 12.2. Figure 12.2: Standard education system definition Secondary education, in particular, has significantly different meanings across countries as shown in this dashboard. In Bangladesh, the education system is divided into three levels: Primary Level (Class 1–5). Students receive their Primary School Certificate at the end of 5th grade. Secondary Level (6-10) or (9-12 at some schools). Students receive their Secondary School Certificate at the end of 10th grade (similar to India and Pakistan). This is equivalent to GCSE in England and the first two years of high school in the United States. There is no middle school system in Bangladesh. Tertiary Level (University) In contrast, Sri Lanka’s education structure is divided into five parts: primary (kindergarden through grade 5), junior secondary (grades 6-9), senior secondary (grades 10-11), collegiate (grades 12-13), and tertiary (university). These differences in education systems mean that the relationships between age, ed_mod_age, educy, educat4, educat5, and educat7 vary by country. The following table displays each country’s most recent value for ed_mod_age and provides a summary for how primary, secondary and tertiary school have been harmonized in SARMD: Country ed_mod_age Primary (Grades) Secondary (Grades) Tertiary Afghanistan 6 1-6 7-12 13- Bangladesh 5 1-5 6-12 13- Bhutan 2 1-9 10-12 13- India NA 1-5 6-12 13- Maldives 5 1-5 6-12 13- Nepal 5 1-6 7-12 13- Pakistan 4 1-8 9-12 13- Sri Lanka 5 1-6 7-12 13- Figure 12.3 presents our analysis of school enrollment of school-age children and young adults (age&lt;25). This analysis consists of studying how atschool changes over time in each country depending on male and urban. It is easy to identify how Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have achieved near-universal primary education by looking at the shape of the figure, which ressembles a plateau, while enrollment rates in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan still have the shape of an inverted U. Figure 12.3: School enrollment over age This analysis has provided the following findings at the country level: Afghanistan Afghanistan has one of the youngest populations in the world, making quality education particularly critical for the rapidly growing numbers of school aged boys and girls. Afghanistan has the widest gap between male/female and urban/rural enrollment rates. The education system is K–12, that is from kindergarden (K) for 4-6 year-olds through twelfth grade (12) for 17-19 year-olds. Long distance to school and reluctance to send children to school are by far the most common reasons for not starting school (mentioned for 37 and 25 percent of those who never attended school), whereas the need for child labor and perceived irrelevance of further education were the most important reasons for terminating education. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at the primary school level and six years at the high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools. Still, enrollment rates fall rapidly especially after age 9. Enrollment rates fall faster for male students than for female students until both lines intersect. At higher levels of education, female enrollment is lower than male enrollment. Bhutan Bhutan has achieved nearly-universal primary education over time and the male/female and urban/rural gaps have narrowed. In Bhutan, primary education is provided free for six years. Secondary education lasts six years and is divided into the lower, middle and higher secondary levels with a duration of two years each. India Unfortunately, surveys from India do not collect enough information about individuals’ general educational level to complete this analysis. Maldives Our figures show how universal primary education has been achieved in Maldives. Still, a wide gap between male and female enrollment rates remains at higher levels of education. Nepal Primary education in Nepal consists of grades one through eight. Secondary education are grades nine and ten, and Higher Secondary Levels cover grades eleven and twelve. Pre-primary education is available in some areas, and students usually begin grade one at age six. A Basic Education Examination is given on grade eight. A national Secondary Education Exam examination is conducted at the end of grade 10. Completing grade 12 examination leads to the School Leaver’s Certificate. However, it is clear from the figures that enrollment rates start to fall before reaching grade 12. Pakistan In Pakistan, the gap between urban and rural enrollment rates is very clear. There also seems to be a great increase in enrollment of young children from 2013 to 2015. The education system in Pakistan is divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through five), middle (grades six through eight), high (grades nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate), intermediate (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees. Sri Lanka Sri Lanka’s education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, collegiate, and tertiary. Primary education lasts five to six years (Kindergarden through grade 5) and at the end of this period, the students may elect to write a national exam called the Scholarship exam. This exam allows students with exceptional skills to move on to better schools. After primary education, the junior secondary level (referred to as middle school in some schools) lasts for 4 years (Grades 6-9) followed by 2 years (Grades 10-11) of the senior secondary level which is the preparation for the General Certificate of Education (G.C.E) Ordinary Level (O/Ls). According to the Sri Lankan law, it is compulsory that all children go to school till grade 9 (age 14) at which point they can choose to continue their education or drop out and engage in apprenticeship for a job or farming. This is very clear in our figures where enrollment rates drop shortly after age 15. You may access our full Stata do-file by accessing the following link.

["understanding-poverty-through-household-and-individual-level-characteristics.html", "Chapter 13 Understanding poverty through household and individual level characteristics 13.1 Linear model results 13.2 Logit model results Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India Maldives Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka ", " Chapter 13 Understanding poverty through household and individual level characteristics Abstract: We apply household-level multivariate regression modeling to identify key characteristics of poor households in South Asia. In the linear regression model, the dependent variable is the logarithm of expenditures per capita divided by the $1.90 poverty line. In the logit model, the dependent variable is binary and indicates whether the household is poor or not. This type of analysis has allowed us to reject a few hypotheses. For example, it is not true in general that female-headed households have lower levels of expenditures per capita. It is true, however, that urban households have significantly higher expenditures per capita. Increasing the size of the household increases the probability of falling below the poverty line. This analysis has allowed to quantify the magnitude of these effects using harmonized variables for surveys available in SARMD. Regression analysis is commonly undertaken to identify the effects of different characteristics on expenditures per capita and poverty. Some of these characteristics may include independent variables at the individual (age, gender, marital status), household (household size, housing, access to assets), community (urban/rural), and regional (state/province) levels. These variables have been harmonized in SARMD. For example, the characteristics of the household head, such as age, educy, and male, may be identified using relationharm==1 or relationcs==1. In this chapter, we provide a template for any user attempting to explain the levels of expenditure per capita (the dependent variable) as a function of a variety of harmonized independent variables contained in SARMD. In the linear regression model, the dependent variable is the logarithm of expenditures per capita divided by the $1.90 poverty line. In the logit model, the dependent variable is binary and indicates whether the household is poor or not. A typical analysis of expenditures per capita may look something like this: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\ln \\left( \\frac{y_{i}}{1.90} \\right) = \\beta_{0} +\\beta_1 X_{i}+\\beta_2 Z_{i}+\\varepsilon _{i} \\end{equation} \\] This equation is said to be in the semi-log form because only the dependent variable is in logarithm. The coefficients in the semi-log model are partial or semi-elasticities. The model assumes a linear relationship between \\(\\ln (y_{i}/1.90)\\), \\(X_{i}\\), and \\(Z_{i}\\), where \\(X_{i}\\) are independent variables for household head \\(i\\) and \\(Z_{i}\\) are independent variables for household \\(i\\). The \\(\\beta\\)’s are the coefficients we are trying to estimate. \\(\\varepsilon _{i}\\) represents a normally-distributed random error term. The regression analysis of a binary variable determines the probability of an outcome rather than an alternative outcome, in this case, falling below the poverty line or not: \\[ \\begin{equation} poor\\_int = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; if &amp; \\ln \\left( \\frac{y_{i}}{1.90} \\right) &lt; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; if &amp; \\ln \\left( \\frac{y_{i}}{1.90} \\right) \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\end{equation} \\] A two-step sample design, first selecting clusters and then households, generates a sample in which households are not randomly distributed over space. One complication of clustering is that the error term is correlated within cluster. Interviewing several households on a same block reduces survey costs, but may also lead to data being influenced by common unobserved cluster-specific characteristics. Surveys are also commonly designed to generate statistics for population subgroups defined by geographical area or ethnicity. Stratification guarantees there will be enough observations to permit estimates for each of these groups. Deaton (1997) provides an example. Suppose we know average rural income is lower than average urban income. A stratified survey would be two identical surveys, one rural and one urban, each of which would estimate average income. The average income for the whole country would be calculated by weighting together the urban and rural means using the proportion of the population in each group as weights. Unfortunately, psu and strata are not always available in SARMD as shown in Figure 13.1, but we use them whenever they are available. We selected male, age, hsize, urban, electricity, ownhouse, and subnatid1 as control variables because they are present in most of the surveys and they have a low percentage of missing observations. Figure 13.1: Summary statistics An example of how to conduct these regressions is provided below: * Preamble clear all eststo clear * Open data datalibweb, country(BGD) year(2016) type(SARMD) mod(IND) /// vermast(01) veralt(03) surveyid(HIES) * Declare survey design for dataset svyset psu [pw=pop_wgt], strata(strata) * Generate dependent variable gen ln_welfare_perc=ln(welfare/cpi/ppp/365*12/1.90) * Define control variables gen age_squared=age^2 local controls &quot;i.male age age_squared hsize i.urban /// i.electricity i.ownhouse i.subnatid1&quot; * Describe data sum ln_welfare_perc poor_int `controls&#39; /// if relationharm==1 [aw=pop_wgt] * Conduct regressions eststo model1_linear: svy: reg ln_welfare_perc /// `controls&#39; if relationharm==1 eststo model2_logit: svy: logit poor_int /// `controls&#39; if relationharm==1 * Present results in table esttab *, se r2 label * Present results in figure coefplot 13.1 Linear model results Figure 13.2 displays the results of the linear model regression by variable. The confidence interval gives a range of values such that if the experiment was run many times (e.g., 10,000 times), the range would contain the true parameter 95% of the time. Note how the confidence intervals become wider when we incorporate the survey design variables psu and strata. In a semi-log model, semi elasticities are interpreted as proportionate changes rather than levels of changes. For example, given \\(\\beta=0.02\\), a one-unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with a proportionate increase of 2% in \\(E(y|x)\\). Figure 13.2: Linear regression estimates Based on this analysis, we provide the following highlights: Urban expenditures per capita are 20-30% above rural, once controlling for other household characteristics. Age of the household head follows the expected non-linear behavior. The coefficient on age is positive, while the coefficient on age squared is negative. The mixed results obtained from gender of the household head must be treated with caution, but they suggest it is not true in general that female-headed households have lower levels of expenditures per capita as one may expect. Increasing the size of the household consistently reduces expenditures per capita within a range from -2% to -13%. Figure 13.3 displays the results of the linear model regression by survey. Figure 13.3: Linear regression estimates 13.2 Logit model results Logistic regression, also called a logit model, is used to model dichotomous outcome variables. In the logit model the log odds ratio of the outcome is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1-p} \\right) = \\beta_{0} +\\beta_1 X_{i}+\\beta_2 Z_{i}+\\varepsilon _{i} \\end{equation} \\] where \\(p\\) is the probability of being poor (defined as expenditures per capita being below the $1.90 poverty line). In this model, the dependent variable maps probability ranging between 0 and 1 to log odds ratio ranging from negative infinity to positive infinity. Figure 13.4 displays the results of the logit model regression by variable. As expected, the signs are reversed to those obtained from the linear regression.

According to multinomial logit analysis, controlling for demographic conditions including age, education level, and household size, probability of being in lowerst quintile level is higher among parents and single parent household in most of the countries in the region. Households classified as couple with children also include grand parents and grand children and the share of female singe parents is bigger than male single parents. The finding shows that households with old or female caregivers may need more social protection to support their children as well as their own welfare. What does it imply? - Household with less earners and socially marginalized members are more likely to remain poor - The family structure makes it difficult for housholds to depart from poverty - How social protection can effectively target vulnerable groups among the poor "],
["access-to-goods.html", "Chapter 15 Access to Goods Development of Access to Cell Phone", " Chapter 15 Access to Goods Development of Access to Cell Phone Figure 15.1: Access to Cell Phone and Electricity One of the most unexpected phenomenena in developing countries is that more people have access to mobile phones even than to electricity. South Asia region is no exception for this developmen as cell phone users have significantly grew in all countries. Even among those who don’t have access to electricity still have access to cell phones. With the exception of Afganistan, at least 80 percent of total population has access to cell phone in most recent years. In Bhutan, the percentage of access to cell phone was less than 1 percent in 2003 but the ownership rate has jumped to 84 percent within 14 years. In Sri Lanka and Pakistan, 9 out of 10 housesholds own cell phones. Another interesting finding is that Some households with cell phones live out of electricity. In india and Bangladesh, among the cell phone users of 84.4 and 68.7 percent respectively, 15.1 and 12.8 percent of them do not have access to electricity. This implies higher entry barriers for accessing basic infrastructure in developing countries as financial resources and administrative capacity are limited in those countries. Sharp growth in the access to cell phone presents greater opportnunities for developing countries.Effective usage of technology may help compensate the shortage of infrastructure in those countries. Low participation in development aid projects shows limited accessibility of aid programs among vulnerable households who need assistance as well. Cell phones have been widely used in eduation, health and agriculture sectors by efficiently sharing knowledge with people without any costs. One prominent example of using this digital development is a mobile banking platform which already started to grow in India and Bangladesh with the aid of many development agencies. This mobile money transfer service allows users to pay for everyday goods and services, take out and repay loans, and send remittances to family in remote locations. Technology may not address development challenges alone in SAR, but facilitating the usage of cell phones in development projects may help reducing poverty more effectively. "],

Child marriage affects both girls and boys, but it mostly occurs among girls especially in South Asia. South Asia has the highest rates of child marriage in the world. India and Bangladesh belong to top 10 countries with highest rate of child marriage. Almost half of all women aged 20-24 years reported being married before the age of 18.

["poverty-measurement-methodology.html", "Chapter 4 Poverty measurement methodology", " Chapter 4 Poverty measurement methodology The starting point in monitoring progress in poverty reduction and enhancing shared prosperity in the region of South Asia is to have household consumption survey data that are not only available at reasonably frequent intervals, but are also comparable over time (Serajuddin et al. (2015)). Assuming we have computed comparable consumption expenditures at the household level, several spatial and temporal adjustments are necessary to take into account differences in costs of living across time and across countries. First, a consumer price index (CPI) is necessary to measure by how much the general price level in a country has changed over time. Deflating all nominal expenditures to real expenditures allows to ensure that welfare comparisons between two periods are not being driven by inflation. Figure 4.1 displays how the CPI has changed for each country in South Asia over time. Figure 4.1: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Second, spatial price differences, typically between urban and rural areas, can also be large and it is important to take them into account. In South Asia, price levels for rural households are often lower than for urban households. The ideal way to control for spatial differences in prices is to use a Paasche or Laspeyres index to account for differences in the cost of living across space. Third, it is necessary to convert expenditures to a common currency taking into account purchasing power. At present, data on purchasing power parity (PPP) comes from the International Comparison Program (ICP) collected in 2011, which is absent for Afghanistan. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalize the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. The PPP between countries A and B measures the number of units of country A’s currency required to purchase a basket of goods or services in country A as compared to one unit of country B’s currency to purchase a similar basket of goods in country B. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per US dollar and shown in the following table: Country Currency ICP 2011 Afghanistan Afghan afghani NA Bangladesh Bangladeshi taka 24.8493 Bhutan Bhutanese ngultrum 16.96292 India Indian rupee 13.98707 Maldives Maldivian rufiyaa 10.67606 Nepal Nepalese rupee 25.75928 Pakistan Pakistani rupee 25.41426 Sri Lanka Sri Lankan rupee 42.21894 A fourth adjustment is dividing total household expenditure by some measure of the number of people in the household, and to assign the resulting per capita welfare measure to each household member as an individual. Later in the applications, we show how larger households typically have lower per capita expenditure levels than smaller households. In South Asia, the consequences of dividing total household expenditures by a greater number of individuals would not be complete without considering the extent of economies of scale within the household and a discussion of how much children and the elderly typically consume compared to adults. The FGT measures devised by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) remain the most commonly used to measure poverty. A headcount ratio may be calculated in STATA as in the example below: * Example: Calculating poverty headcounts with 1.90 poverty line * Calculate per capita expenditures by dividing total * expenditures by the number of household members gen welfare=total_exp/hsize * Calculate real per capita expenditures by turning nominal * per capita expenditures into 2011 purchasing power parity * (PPP) dollars welfare_ppp = welfare/cpi2011/icp2011/365*12 * Generate a dummy variable to determine whether real per capita * expenditures fall below the 1.90 2011 PPP dollars poverty line gen poor190 = welfare_ppp &lt; 1.90 * Calculate the weighted average of the dummy variable to measure * the proportion of the population that falls below the 1.90 2011 * PPP dollars poverty line sum poor190 [aw=wgt] The variable welfare contains the monthly nominal expenditures per capita in local currency. Once turned into daily 2011 USD (PPP), these values may be compared over time and between countries as in Figure 4.2. The area to the left of the US$1.90 extreme poverty line represents the proportion of individuals living in extreme poverty.
