According to the SARMD protocols, if the raw data does not have the necessary information to harmonize a particular SARMD variable, the variable must still be included in the dataset as a vector of missing values. If the variable is absent from the dataset, it could be the case that the raw data contains the necessary information to harmonize such variable, but it has not been harmonized yet; or that there is no information in the raw data and previous harmonizers decided not to include it in the variable as a vector of missing values. As it is impossible to know what the correct answer is, figure 9.1 shows all the variables that have not been harmonized in each dataset available in SARMD. For example, note that for the Maldives SARMD collection in 1997 and 2004 all the variables of the assets category are absent from the dataset. Or, even more surprising, Pakistan 2015 lacks several variables of the assets category that were present in the surveys of previoues years. Moreoever, some variables like landphone, cellphone, and computer that are present in 2015, were absen before 2015.
