Figure 7.1: Seven categories of harmonized variables Figure 7.2 displays which variables are currently available for each household survey. The different colors indicate a variable’s percentage of missing values. Figure 7.2: SARMD Availability and missing observations 7.1 Basic survey characteristics Figure 7.3: Basic survey characteristics The essential variables that identify each dataset and individual within a household are countrycode, survey, year, vermast, veralt, idh, and idp. Weights are defined as wgt and pop_wgt=wgt*hsize. The dates of the survey are recorded as int_year and int_month. The geographical location within the country’s administrative division is recorded as subnatid1, and in some cases, subnatid2 may provide a more specific location. Unfortunately, the variables psu and strata are only available for a few surveys. The same is true for the spatial deflator spdef. 7.1.1 countrycode countrycode is a string variable that takes the following values: Country countrycode Afghanistan AFG Bangladesh BGD Bhutan BTN India IND Sri Lanka LKA Maldives MDV Nepal NPL Pakistan PAK 7.1.2 survey survey is a string variable 7.1.3 year year is a four digit numeric variable. 7.1.4 vermast vermast is a two digit string variable that indicates the master version. 7.1.5 veralt veralt is a two digit string variable that indicates the harmonization version. 7.1.6 idh idh is a string variable that serves as household id or household identificator. 7.1.7 idp idp is a string variable that serves as individual id or individual identificator. 7.1.8 wgt wgt is a numeric variable, also called an estimation weight, that is used to obtain estimates of population parameters of interest. The weight of a given individual may be interpreted as the number of individuals from the population that are represented by this sample unit. For example, if a random sample of 25 individuals has been selected from a population of 100, then each of the 25 sampled individuals may be viewed as representing 4 individuals of the population (Lavallée and Beaumont (2015)). 7.1.9 pop_wgt pop_wgt=wgt*hsize is a numeric variable that is used to obtain estimates of population parameters of interest when the survey data is collapsed at the household level. 7.1.10 int_year int_year is a four digit numeric variable that specifies the year of the interview. 7.1.11 int_month int_month is a numeric variable that specifies the month of the interview (e.g., 1=January, 2=February, 3=March, etc.) 7.1.12 subnatid1 subnatid1 is a country-specific categorical string variable to identify the highest level of subnational regional identifiers at which the survey is representative. 7.1.13 subnatid2 subnatid2 is a country-specific categorical string variable to identify the second highest level of subnational regional identifiers at which the survey is representative. 7.1.14 psu psu identifies the primary sampling units, which are the groups selected as the first stage of a multi-stage sample. 7.1.15 strata strata identifies the sampling strata. 7.1.16 spdef spdef identifies the spatial deflator. 7.2 Demographic variables There are currently six essential demographic variables in SARMD: age, hsize, male, relationcs, relationharm and marital. Population pyramids such as the one provided in Figure 7.4 allow to see how countries’ demographics change over time while showing whether the marital status of individuals has been harmonized adequately. About 63.7 percent of Afghans are under 25 years of age, reflecting a steep pyramid age structure. Figure 7.4: Population pyramids 7.2.1 age age is a numeric variable that indicates the age of an individual in years. Age is an important variable for most socio-economic analyses and must be established as accurately as possible especially for children aged less than 5 years. age&gt;= 98 must be coded as 98. Missing values should be recorded as age=., never use age=99. According to SARMD, the youngest country in the region is Afghanistan and the oldest is Sri Lanka. 7.2.2 hsize hsize is a numeric variable that measures household size. Household size is close to seven in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Maldives, and much closer to 4-5 in the rest of the countries. Figure 7.5 shows how average household size declines as we move to higher quintiles of per capita expenditures. Average household size is 9.66 in the poorest per capita expenditure quintile of Afghanistan, compared to 3.91 in the richest per capita expenditure quintile of Sri Lanka. Having more children (individuals &lt; 15 years old) is negatively correlated with household per capita expenditures. We would expect higher poverty rates among large households and households with more children. Figure 7.5: Household composition and expenditures 7.2.3 male male indicates the gender of the household member. 1=Male 0=Female 7.2.4 relationcs relationcs refers to the original categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head. They change from survey to survey and may include categories as: Household Head Husband/Wife Son/Daughter Grandchildren Grandfather/Grandmother Father or mother Father-in-law/Mother-in-law Brother or sister Brother-in-law/sister-in-law Nephew or niece Domestic servants Employee Other family relative Unrelated member 7.2.5 relationharm relationharm refers to the simplified categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head: 1=Household Head 2=Spouse 3=Children 4=Parents 5=Other relatives 6=Non-relatives 7.2.6 marital marital classifies individuals according to their marital status into these simplified categories: 1=Married 2=Never Married 3=Living Together 4=Divorced/separated 5=Widowed 7.3 Education There are currently eight essential education variables in SARMD: literacy, atschool, everattend, ed_mod_age, educy, educat4, educat5, and educat7. 7.3.1 literacy literacy is a dummy variable that indicates whether an individual is able to both read and write. A person is considered literate if she can both read and write and not just one or the other. A semi-literate person (one who can read, but cannot write) is said to be illiterate. In the case where the survey asks only whether a person can read but does not ask if they can write, literacy cannot be determined, and must be coded as missing. The adult literacy rate – referring to the population aged 15 and over – is an indicator that measures the accumulated achievement of the education system. The youth literacy rate – the literacy rate in the population aged 15-24 – reflects the outcomes of primary education over roughly the previous 10 years and is a measure of recent educational progress. Figure 7.6 allows the user to plot literacy rates at a subnational level by gender and age groups. Figure 7.6: Harmonized asset ownership in latest household survey round 7.3.2 atschool atschool is a dummy variable that indicates whether individual is currently enrolled in school. 7.3.3 everattend everattend is a dummy variable that indicates whether individual has ever attended school. 7.3.4 ed_mod_age ed_mod_age is the minimum age level at which the education module of the questionnaire is applied. 7.3.5 educy educy is a numeric variable that measures the number of years of education of an individual. It should not include pre-school. 7.3.6 educat4 educat4 is a numeric categorical variable that presents the level of education of an individual in four categories: 1=No education 2=Primary (complete or incomplete) 3=Secondary (complete or incomplete) 4=Tertiary (complete or incomplete) Secondary is everything from the end of primary to before tertiary (for example, grade 7 through 12). Figure 7.7 allows the user to present the absolute and relative frequencies of these categorical variables by survey. Figure 7.7: Level of education categories 7.3.7 educat5 educat5 is a numeric categorical variable that presents the level of education of an individual in five categories: 1=No education 2=Primary incomplete 3=Primary complete but secondary incomplete 4=Secondary complete 5=Some tertiary/post-secondary 7.3.8 educat7 educat7 is a numeric categorical variable that presents the level of education of an individual in seven categories: 1=No education 2=Primary incomplete 3=Primary complete 4=Secondary incomplete 5=Secondary complete 6=Higher than secondary but not university 7=University incomplete or complete 7.4 Durable assets The sixteen asset binary variables (1=Yes, 0=No) in SARMD represent whether households have access to a particular durable asset. They do not indicate the quantity of assets available or who is the owner of the asset within the household. The variables are defined at the household level and do not represent whether each individual owns an asset in particular, but whether the household as a whole has access to it. Therefore, a household where every member owns a cellphone and a household where only one member owns a cellphone are both cellphone=1 and cannot be distinguished. The harmonization of these asset variables is limited by their availability in the household questionnaire. For example, cow, chicken, and buffalo cannot be harmonized if a survey does not cover live-stocking activities. It may also be that some of these assets are unnecessary (a fan in cold weather), obsolete (land phone), or too basic (lamp) to be included in a questionnaire. Quality checks were conducted to make sure that these variables could only be equal to 0 or 1. We also verified that the value was the same within each household. A deeper look at these asset variables allowed to identify some interesting trends. Figure 7.8 displays the percentage of households that have access to an asset by country for the latest survey round available. It shows that cellphones are the most accessible assets and that there can be a wide range between the minimum and the maximum. Figure 7.8: Harmonized asset ownership in latest household survey round Figure 7.9 shows a clear exponential trend between the percentage of households that have access to electricity and the percentage of households that have access to a refrigerator. A similar relationship with electricity was found for television, washing machine, and fan. A quality check was conducted to identify the number of observations where the household had no access to electricity, but still had access to an asset. In some cases, it might seem illogical, for example, for a household to own a television if it does not have access to electricity. In Afghanistan (2013), 7,771 out of 20,773 households seemed to have a television and no electricity. However, a mistake in the harmonization process was identified and this number was reduced to 3,119 out of 20,773 households once the mistake was fixed. Still, 13-20% of observations in Afghanistan have consistently reported having a television and no electricity.
