Ideally it should be not only available at reasonably frequent intervals, but be also comparable over time (Serajuddin et al. 2015). Assuming we have computed comparable consumption expenditures at the household level, several spatial and temporal adjustments are necessary to take into account differences in costs of living across time and across countries. 4.1 Components of the consumption welfare aggregate food, non-food, durables, housing, and price deflation 4.2 Additional factors that affect the welfare aggregate First, a consumer price index (CPI) is necessary to measure by how much the general price level in a country has changed over time. Deflating all nominal expenditures to real expenditures allows to ensure that welfare comparisons between two periods are not being driven by inflation. Figure 4.1 displays how the CPI has changed for each country in South Asia over time. Figure 4.1: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Second, spatial price differences, typically between urban and rural areas, can also be large and it is important to take them into account. In South Asia, price levels for rural households are often lower than for urban households. The ideal way to control for spatial differences in prices is to use a Paasche or Laspeyres index to account for differences in the cost of living across space. Third, it is necessary to convert expenditures to a common currency taking into account purchasing power. At present, data on purchasing power parity (PPP) comes from the International Comparison Program (ICP) collected in 2011, which is absent for Afghanistan. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalize the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. The PPP between countries A and B measures the number of units of country A’s currency required to purchase a basket of goods or services in country A as compared to one unit of country B’s currency to purchase a similar basket of goods in country B. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per US dollar and shown in the following table: Country Currency ICP 2011 Afghanistan Afghan afghani NA Bangladesh Bangladeshi taka 24.8493 Bhutan Bhutanese ngultrum 16.96292 India Indian rupee 13.98707 Maldives Maldivian rufiyaa 10.67606 Nepal Nepalese rupee 25.75928 Pakistan Pakistani rupee 25.41426 Sri Lanka Sri Lankan rupee 42.21894 A fourth adjustment is dividing total household expenditure by some measure of the number of people in the household, and to assign the resulting per capita welfare measure to each household member as an individual. Later in the applications, we show how larger households typically have lower per capita expenditure levels than smaller households. In South Asia, the consequences of dividing total household expenditures by a greater number of individuals would not be complete without considering the extent of economies of scale within the household and a discussion of how much children and the elderly typically consume compared to adults. 4.3 Estimation of poverty The FGT measures devised by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) remain the most commonly used to measure poverty. They are defines as: \\[\\begin{equation} P_{\\alpha}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum^{N}_{i=1}I_{i}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}-u_{i}}{\\bar{u}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\end{equation}\\] where N is the sample size, \\(\\bar{u}\\) is the scalar-valued poverty line, \\(u_{i}\\) is the flow-based measure of welfare (income, expenditures, assets), \\(I_{i}\\) is an indicator variable taking value one if \\(u_{i} &lt; \\bar{u}\\) and zero otherwise, and \\(\\alpha\\) is a parameter reflecting the weight placed on the severity of poverty. Setting \\(\\alpha =0\\) yields the poverty headcount ratio \\(P_{0}\\) (the share of a population falling below the poverty line). The higher order measures, \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\), yield the poverty gap measure (the money metric measure of the average financial transfer needed to bring all poor households up to the poverty line) and the squared poverty gap (an indicator of the severity of poverty that is sensitive to the distribution of well-being among the poor). As we progress from \\(P_{0}\\) to \\(P_{1}\\) to \\(P_{2}\\), the \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) measure gets more and more sensitive to extremely low incomes. 4.4 A Technical example * 1. Let us first load any household survey. datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) clear * 2. we deflate the `welfare` aggragate to PPP 2011 values. /* Calculate per capita expenditures by dividing total expenditures by the number of household members */ gen welfare=total_exp/hsize /* Calculate real per capita expenditures by turning nominal per capita expenditures into 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars */ gen double welfare_ppp = welfare/cpi2011/icp2011/365 table year [w = weight_p], c(mean welfare mean welfare_ppp) format(%11.2f) A headcount ratio may be calculated in STATA like this: * Generate a dummy variable to determine whether real per capita * expenditures fall below the 1.90 2011 PPP dollars poverty line gen poor190 = welfare_ppp &lt; 1.90 * Calculate the weighted average of the dummy variable to measure * the proportion of the population that falls below the 1.90 2011 * PPP dollars poverty line sum poor190 [aw=wgt] If you want to calculate all the FGT family at once, you could do something like this: /*================================================== poverty measures ==================================================*/ local plines &quot;1.9 3.2 5.5&quot; local wvar &quot;welfare_ppp&quot; foreach pl of local plines { gen pl_`=100*`pl&#39;&#39; = `pl&#39; forval a=0/2 { gen fgt`a&#39;_`=100*`pl&#39;&#39; = 100*((`wvar&#39;&lt;`pl&#39;)*(1-(`wvar&#39;/`pl&#39;))^`a&#39;) } } tabstat fgt0* [`w&#39; = weight_p], by(year) nototal * tabstatmat table year [`w&#39; = weight_p], c(mean fgt0_190 mean fgt0_320 mean fgt0_550 ) The variable welfare contains the monthly nominal expenditures per capita in local currency. Once turned into daily 2011 USD (PPP), these values may be compared over time and between countries as in Figure 4.2. The area to the left of the US$1.90 extreme poverty line represents the proportion of individuals living in extreme poverty.
