["note-water.html", "Chapter 18 Water Supply and Sanitation Stata code", " Chapter 18 Water Supply and Sanitation Indicators related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) monitor progress on basic living conditions of households and provide important information on health, education, and welfare that cannot be captured from monetary expenditure or income variables. In SARMD, there are several variables that represent water and sanitation condition but variables for hygiene are not yet available. Whether a household has access to piped water and basic sanitation facility can be estimated by using the binary variables piped_water and toilet_acc, respectively. Besides these two WASH indicators, quality of drinking water can also be identified with variable water_source, which indicates the source of drinking water, but most of the harmonized surveys in the region do not have this variable. As explained in the Introduction, the comparability across countries is difficult because of the differences in definitions of certain concepts, including most of the WASH indicators. Thus, you need to be cautions when comparing estimates across countries in the region like the share of access to water and sanitation. For instance, the questionnaires of most countries make explicit distinction between access to piped water from inside or outside the dwelling. However, surveys like the one from Nepal do not make such a distinction, which precludes the comparability across the countries in the region. Also, (some countries have a categorical question that indicates public flush toilet shared among multiple households and includes these category as access to toilet.) Jayne, please clarify the sentence in parentheses. Provide examples. Figure 18.1: Access to piped water and toilet Piped water is considered improved water supply in contrast to other kinds of access to water like surface water, unprotected water, or wells (which, in some cases, are contaminated). Overall, less than half of the population do not have access to piped water. In Afghanistan and Bangladesh, only 9.7 and 11.3 percent of the population have access to piped water and the rest of them reply on informal and relatively unsafe water sources. Even though the share of households that have access to toilet is relatively higher than the one for piped water supply, more than a third of the population in most countries still do not have proper sanitation system. In Nepal, for instance, the condition of access to toilet is worse than that of access to piped water as more than 60 percent of households do not have access to toilet. Figure 18.2 shows the access to piped water and toilet for both the bottom 40 and top 60 of each country. As expected, poor households suffermore from the shortage of piped water and toilet. The gap of access to piped water between bottom 40 and top 60 groups is extensive in Bangladesh where only 2.4 percent of poor households have access to piped water while this share becomes 4 times higher for non-poor households. Even though these countries have shown a modest improvement of the gap, data shows that poor households are highly marginalized in obtaining enough access to clean water. Figure 18.2: Access to Piped Water Access to toilet has gradually increased for both poor and non-poor groups but this improvement has primarily occurred among richer households. Nepal shows the largest gap where 29 percent of richer households have access to proper sanitation but only 4.3 percent of the bottom 40 group has access to toilet. A slightly higher growth rate of the access share among poor households still confirms extremely low starting conditions compared to the non-poor. Figure 18.3: Access to Toilet Most of the population in South Asia live without safe water and sanitation, and poor people tend to encounter more severe shortage of basic conditions. This limited access to safe water and sanitation may lead to poor hygiene behaviors, which are generally associated with child mortality, morbidity, undernutrition and, indirectly, poor provision of quality education. Thus, it seems necessary to establish proper infrastructure for marginalized groups to mitigate greater health and thus poverty challenges.
