There are several variables that represent water and sanitation condition but variables for hygiene are not available in the harmonized data. The most commonly found indicators in the data include “piped_water” and “toilet_acc”. The binary variables indicate whether a household has access to piped water and basic sanitation facility. Beside the two WASH indicators, quality of drinking water can be also identified with a variable that indicates the source of drinking water, but most of the harmonized data in the region do not have this variable. The water and sanitation variables are consistently observed over time, allowing for examining the improvement of the conditions. With information on welfare distribution, users can also analyze how these conditions vary by income level. However, users need to be cautious when comparing the share of access to water and sanitation across countries in the region. Definition of piped water can be different since some countries further specify the location of piped water, and categories of toilet is not universal in the region. Figure 18.1: Sanitation Indicators Piped water is considered as improved water supply than surface water, unprotected and possibly contaminated wells. Overall, less than half of the population do not have access to piped water. In Afghanistan and Bangladesh, only 9.7 and 11.3 percent of the population have access to piped water and the rest of them reply on informal and relatively unsafe water sources. With regards to sanitation condition in the region, even though the share of households who have access to toilet is relatively higher than the one for piped water supply, more than a third of the population in most countries still do not have proper sanitation system. In Nepal, the condition of access to toilet is worse than that of access to piped water as more than 60 percent of households do not have access to toilet. Figure below shows the access to piped water and toilet for both bottom 40 and top 60 groups. As expected, poor households more suffer from the shortage of piped water and toilet. The gap of access to piped water between bottom 40 and top 60 groups is extensive in Bangladesh where only 2.4 percent of poor households have access to piped water while this share becomes 4 times higher for non-poor households. Even though these countries have shown a modest improvement of the gap, data shows that poor households are highly marginalized in obtaining enough access to clean water. Figure 18.2: Access to Piped Water Access to toilet has gradually increased for both poor and non-poor groups but this improvement has primarily occurred among richer households. Nepal shows the largest gap where 29 percent of richer households have access to proper sanitation but only 4.3 percent of the bottom 40 group has the access to toilet. A slightly higher growth rate of the access share among poor households still confirms extremely low starting conditions compared to non-poor groups. Figure 18.3: Access to Toilet Most of the population in South Asia live without safe water and sanitation, and poor people tend to encounter more severe shortage of the basic conditions. This limited access to safe water and sanitation may lead to poor hygiene behaviors, which become the leading causes of child mortality and morbidity. These further contribute to undernutrition and poor provision of quality education especially for girls and boys in the region. Thus, establishing infrastructure for marginalized groups is necessary in mitigating greater health and thus poverty challenges.
