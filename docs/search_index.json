Please do not cite or distribute without permission of the SARTSD This book is about the analysis of household surveys from South Asian countries and is intended to be used as a manual by any researcher interested in using the South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD). The household surveys contained in SARMD provide a rich and open source of data on economic behavior and expenditure patterns, demographics, educational attainment, employment, the acquisition of durable assets, and housing. The harmonization of these surveys allows to compare social and economic statistics among the eight countries in the region. These guidelines are intended to teach you everything you need to work efficiently with SARMD. You will learn how to access the microdata through the datalibweb system and how to perform basic (and not so basic) socioeconomic calculations. We will study how comparable household surveys are across the region and evaluate the quality of the harmonization process. We also provide several examples on how to conduct analysis at the regional or country level in our analytical notes. Team This book has been created by the SAR Team for Statistical Development under the direction of Benu Bidani. The team is composed by R.Andrés Castañeda Aguilar, Jayne Jungsun Yoo, and Francisco Javier Parada Gómez Urquiza.

There are several advantages to composing books (especially technical books) using Markdown: You can create different types of output formats such as PDF, HTML, WORD, EPub, and even Kindle files. Everything is written using plain text, so you may enjoy the benefits of tracking changes through collaborative platforms as Git. You can execute R or Stata code directly from the text, include code chunks, and present its corresponding results inline wherever you want within the document. You can add features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and import GitBook styles to create elegant and beautiful books. Software information and conventions All the pieces of code are written like this and sometimes you may find chunks of code like this: This is a chunk of code, and everything in it may be copied and pasted directly into the corresponding execution console, which could be Stata or R. Most of the code chunks in this book are written in Stata syntax, but you may find some pieces of code written in R language as well.
