# (PART) Analytical Notes {-}

# Introduction to the Analytical Notes {#analysis .unnumbered}
***

This chapter provides analytic applications of SARMD for research in a variety of topics. We first present access to durable assets that vary by expenditures. Next, we show the patterns of school enrollment by age to figure how each country has progressed in educational attainment. Information on demographic characteristics also enables to analyze the relationship between poverty and household composition. Finally, we present new possibilities with technology by showing the evidence of improved cell phone access to reduce poverty among developing countries in South Asia. Users may access the Stata do-files to replicate and modify these analytical notes. We also allow users the possibility to interact with the Tableau dashboards by clicking on them.

# Household Composition and Poverty

***
## Certain types of household are more susceptible to poverty


```{r hhtype, fig.cap='Household Type and Probability', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/poor_hhtype.png")
```

Among differnt household types, couple with children and single parent households are more susceptible to poverty. According to multinomial logit analysis, controlling for demographic conditions including age, education level, and household size, probability of being in lowerst quintile level is higher among parents and single parent household in most of the countries in the region. Households classified as couple with children also include grand parents and grand children and the share of female singe parents is bigger than male single parents. The finding shows that households with old or female caregivers may need more social protection to support their children as well as their own welfare. 

What does it imply?
- Household with less earners and socially marginalized members are more likely to remain poor
- The family structure makes it difficult for housholds to depart from poverty 
- How social protection can effectively target vulnerable groups among the poor


## Aceess to Goods

## Cell phones are more common than access to electricity {-}
***

```{r cellphone, fig.cap='Access to Cell Phone and Electricity', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/all.png")
```

There has been a global phenomenon that more people have access to mobile phones. South Asia region is no exception on this where a large share of poor people have access to mobile phones than to electricity or improved water. For all countries in the region, cell phone users have significantyl grew.Even among those who don't have access to electricity still have access to cell phone which implies lower entry barriers to obtain them.  

Why do they have rapid increase in cell phone usage?

What does it imply?
Effective usage of technology may help reduce poverty in developing countries most of which have difficulties in investing in public infrastructure. Also, the low participation in development projects have casted the issue of accessibility of aid programs to local people. With hight percentage of cell phone users, we can compensate the shortcomings of aid program especially in eduation, health and agriculture sectors by efficiently sharing knowledge with people.
