## School enrollment in South Asia

Countries in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) have achieved different levels of progress regarding school enrollment. Sri Lanka achieved near-universal primary education decades ago, while Afghanistan and Pakistan still lag significantly behind other South Asian countries. In this analysis, we compare the education levels achieved across countries considering their different education systems. 

In recent years, South Asian countries have invested in school inputs and directed their efforts towards achieving universal access to primary
education. These investments have led to more children retained in school. According to @students_sar, enrollment in South Asia’s primary schools rose from 75.0 percent in 2000 to 89.0 percent in 2010, bringing it closer to that of the Latin America and the Caribbean (94.0 percent) and East Asia and the Pacific (94.8 percent) regions. Between 1999 and 2010, the number of out-of-school children ages 8–14 years fell from 35 million to 13 million, and the number of out-of-school girls in the region dropped by 59 percent.

[Sustainable Development Goal 4](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/) has ten targets encompassing many different aspects of education. The first target is to ensure that by 2030 all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes. Equality in primary education between girls and boys has improved, but not at all levels of education. 

The South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD) contains the following harmonized variables at the individual level (when `age>=ed_mod_age`) to monitor progress towards the achievement of these goals:  

| Variable	    | Description                     	                |
|-------------	|-------------------------------------------------	|
| `ed_mod_age`| Age at which education module is applied	          | 
| `atschool`	| Individual attending school     (1 = Yes 0 = No)	  |
| `everattend`| Individual ever attended school (1 = Yes 0 = No)    | 
| `literacy`	| Individual can read and write   (1 = Yes 0 = No)	  |
| `educy`	    | Years of education	| 
| `educat4` 	| 1 = No education 2 = Primary (complete or incomplete) 3 = Secondary (complete or incomplete) 4 = Tertiary (complete or incomplete) 	| 
| `educat5` 	| 1 = No education 2 = Primary incomplete 3 = Primary complete but secondary incomplete 4 = Secondary complete 5 = Some tertiary  	| 
| `educat7` 	| 1 = No education 2 = Primary incomplete 3 = Primary complete 4 = Secondary incomplete 5 = Secondary complete 6 = Higher than secondary but not university 7 = University incomplete or complete | 

The most vulnerable group in terms of low literacy is women older than 65 years. Even among younger adults and children, the difference in literacy rates between men and women is wide. Figure \@ref(fig:literacy) allows you to display average literacy rates at a subnational level. Afghanistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world. In 2011, it was estimated at about 31% of the adult population (15 years or older).

Primary, secondary and tertiary education are defined differently in each country. Secondary education, in particular, has significantly different meanings across countries as shown in this [dashboard](https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNAEducationbycategories/Frequency). In Bangladesh, the education system is divided into three levels: 

* Primary Level (Class 1–5). Students receive their Primary School Certificate at the end of 5th grade. 
* Secondary Level (6-10) or (9-12 at some schools). Students receive their Secondary School Certificate at the end of 10th grade (similar to India and Pakistan). This is equivalent to GCSE in England and the first two years of high school in the United States. There is no middle school system in Bangladesh. 
* Tertiary Level (University)

In contrast, Sri Lanka's education structure is divided into five parts: primary (kindergarden through grade 5), junior secondary (grades 6-9), senior secondary (grades 10-11), collegiate (grades 12-13), and tertiary (university). These differences in education systems mean that the relationships between `age`, `ed_mod_age`, `educy`, `educat4`, `educat5`, and `educat7` vary by country. The following table displays each country's most recent value for `ed_mod_age` and provides a summary for how primary, secondary and tertiary school have been harmonized in SARMD: 

```{r harmonizededuc, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='markup', tidy=TRUE, cache=FALSE}

knitr::kable(harmonized_educ,booktabs=TRUE, caption = 'Harmonized education levels')
```

| Country     	| ed_mod_age 	| Primary (Grades) 	| Secondary (Grades) | Tertiary 	|

| Nepal       	|      5     	|   1-6   	|    7-12   	|    13-   	|
| Pakistan    	|      4     	|   1-8   	|    9-12   	|    13-   	|
| Sri Lanka   	|      5     	|   1-6   	|    7-12   	|    13-   	|

Our analysis of school enrollment of school-age children and young adults (`age<25`) consists of studying how `atschool` changes over time in each country depending on `male` and `urban`. It is easy to identify how Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have achieved near-universal primary education by looking at the shape of the figures in the following Tableau dashboard:

[![](figures/atschool_graph.png)](https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_atschool/atschool "The user may interact with this Tableau dashboard by clicking on the figure.")

This analysis has provided the following findings:

### Afghanistan   <img src="figures/Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg" width="40">

Afghanistan has one of the youngest populations in the world, making quality education particularly critical for the rapidly growing numbers of school aged boys and girls. Afghanistan has the widest gap between male/female and urban/rural enrollment rates. The education system is K–12, that is from kindergarten (K) for 4-6 year-olds through twelfth grade (12) for 17-19 year-olds. Long distance to school and reluctance to send children to school are by far the most common reasons for not starting school (mentioned for 37 and 25 percent of those who never attended school), whereas the need for child labor and perceived irrelevance of further education were the most important reasons for terminating education.

### Bangladesh    <img src="figures/Flag_of_Bangladesh.svg" width="40">

In Bangladesh, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at primary school level and six years at high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools. Enrollment rates still fall rapidly. The enrollment rates by age have the shape of an inverted U. Enrollment rates fall faster for male students than for female students. 

### Bhutan        <img src="figures/Flag_of_Bhutan.svg" width="40">

Primary education is provided free for six years. Secondary education lasts six years and is divided into the lower, middle and higher secondary levels with a duration of two years each. Figures show how Bhutan has achieved nearly-universal primary education over time and how the male/female and urban/rural gaps have narrowed. 
 
### India         <img src="figures/Flag_of_India.svg" width="40">

Unfortunately, surveys from India do not collect enough information about individuals' general educational level. 

### Maldives      <img src="figures/Flag_of_Maldives.svg" width="40">

Our figures show that universal primary education has been achieved.

### Nepal         <img src="figures/Flag_of_Nepal.svg.png" width="40">

Primary education in Nepal called consists of grades one through eight. Secondary education are grades nine and ten, and Higher Secondary Levels cover grades eleven and twelve. Pre-primary education is available in some areas, and students usually begin grade one at age six. A Basic Education Examination is given on grade eight. A national Secondary Education Exam examination is conducted at the end of grade 10. Completing grade 12 examination leads to the School Leaver's Certificate. 

### Pakistan      <img src="figures/Flag_of_Pakistan.svg" width="40">

The education system in Pakistan is divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through five), middle (grades six through eight), high (grades nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate), intermediate (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.

### Sri Lanka     <img src="figures/Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg" width="40">

Sri Lanka's education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, collegiate, and tertiary. Primary education lasts five to six years (Kindergarden through grade 5) and at the end of this period, the students may elect to write a national exam called the Scholarship exam. This exam allows students with exceptional skills to move on to better schools. After primary education, the junior secondary level (referred to as middle school in some schools) lasts for 4 years (Grades 6-9) followed by 2 years (Grades 10-11) of the senior secondary level which is the preparation for the General Certificate of Education (G.C.E) Ordinary Level (O/Ls). According to the Sri Lankan law, it is compulsory that all children go to school till grade 9 (age 14) at which point they can choose to continue their education or drop out and engage in apprenticeship for a job or farming. This is very clear in our figures where enrollment rates drop from almost 100 shortly after 15 years old. 

## Understanding poverty through household and individual level characteristics

Regression analysis is commonly undertaken to identify the effects of different characteristics on expenditures per capita. Some of these characteristics may include a household's location, the age, education, and gender of the household head, and household size. These characteristics may be classified at the individual (age, gender, marital status), household (housing, access to assets), community (urban/rural), and regional (state/province) levels. 

In this section, we provide a template for any user attempting to explain the levels of expenditure per capita (the dependent variable) as a function of a variety of harmonized independent variables contained in SARMD. A typical analysis of expenditures per capita may look something like this:

Equation 1

$$f\left(k\right)=\binom{n}{k}p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$$

$$

\begin{equation} 
  \ln (\frac{y_{i)}}{1.90}) = \beta_{0} +\beta X_{i}+\varepsilon _{i}
\end{equation} 

$$

where $X_{i}$ are the independent variables for household $i$ and $\beta$ are the coefficients we are tring to estimate.

## Nonlinear relationship between expenditure and asset acquisition

Energy-using appliances, such as refrigerators, are taken for granted among households in developed countries. However, in developing countries these assets are still scarce and owning a refrigerator can have important consequences on the well-being of a family. This note explains who owns this kind of assets in South Asia with the use of harmonized data from SARMD. Refrigerators, for example, can be common in urban areas of New Delhi and be virtually non-existent in central Afghanistan. The distribution of assets among the population is an indicator in the fight against extreme poverty. Even in developed countries, the possession of valuable assets that facilitate family labor in a meaningful way are quick indicators of economic development in a region and the purchasing power of households.

https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/Note1/Dashboard1

An estimated 368 million people live without electricity in their homes in South Asia, and even among those who have access, many do not own basic assets such as refrigerators, televisions, or washing machines. We study household decisions to acquire assets in the presence of rising incomes. Table ?? demonstrates the low penetration that these energy-consuming assets have in South Asia. As more households currently living in poverty benefit from overall economic development, we would expect a considerable increase in households’ energy use. If one half of the households in India who do not own refrigerators were to buy one, annual nationwide electricity demand would rise by over 10 percent (Wolfram, Shelef, and Gertler 2012). 

We model the nonlinear relationship between income and asset acquisition as in Gertler, Shelef, Wolfram & Fuchs (2016). This paper provides a simple theoretical framework to characterize the effect of income growth on asset purchases when consumers face credit constraints. A nonlinear Engel curve means that as income goes up from initially very low levels, credit-constrained households do not immediately become more likely to purchase an energy-using asset. Households faced with credit constraints become much more likely to purchase energy-using assets with once their income passes a threshold level. We begin by documenting an S-shaped relationship between expenditure and durable asset ownership. Figure 1 plots the share of households that own refrigerators, televisions, and washing machines in India (2011) against household expenditure. 

Figure ?? demostrates how for a group of several assets, asset ownership is high in the Maldives and lower in the rest of South Asia. Filmer and Pritchett, 2001, argue that the first principal component of the household’s ownership of physical assets is highly correlated with household expenditure and can be used as a reasonable proxy.

## Household composition and expenditures

Figure \@ref(fig:children) shows how average household size declines as we move to higher quintiles of per capita expenditures. Average household size is 9.66 in the poorest per capita expenditure quintile of Afghanistan, compared to 3.91 in the richest per capita expenditure quintile of Sri Lanka. Having more children (individuals < 15 years old) is negatively correlated with household per capita expenditures. We would expect higher poverty rates among large households and households with more children.
