# Introduction {-}

The South Asia Micro Database (SARMD) is a regional database of socioeconomic indicators established in 2014 and managed by the South Asia Region Team for Statistical Development (SARTSD). It consists of raw household survey data, documentation, questionnaires, and a repository of do files to reconstruct harmonized variables, consumption aggregates, and poverty estimates. SARMD currently includes the eight countries in the region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), contemplates forty-three surveys, and contains close to a hundred harmonized variables covering the 1993-2017 period.

SARMD follows the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) harmonization guidelines, including the construction of the welfare aggregate used for global poverty monitoring. Given that GMD contains a limited number of variables, SARMD provides users with a larger set of harmonized variables that are comparable across the countries of the South Asia Region, though may not be comparable with countries from other regions. As GMD expands, new variables could be incorporated until users may be referred only to GMD.

Harmonization facilitates the use of household data at a regional level because all the databases in SARMD have a common set of approximately 100 variables with the same variable names, variable labels and value labels. Technically speaking, this does not mean that each variable in each dataset refers to the same thing. For example, even though the variable `welfare` refers to the per capita welfare aggregate used to calculate official poverty rates and inequality indicators, it may include imputed rents in some countries (e.g., Bhutan and Bangladesh), but not in others (e.g., India and Afghanistan). This is so because questionnaires, sample frames, recollection periods, and several other factors make a strict harmonization and perfect comparability impossible across countries.

The best solution to lack of perfect comparability across countries is known as  *ex--post* harmonization, a harmonization effort starting from non-harmonized raw data. Two main approaches can be followed on *ex--post* harmonization: the minimum common denominator approach and the benchmark approach. The former refers to harmonizing variables according to the minimum common set of characteristics that all datasets share with respect to one variable. For example, if the minimum number of industrial sectors common to all surveys in all countries were two (e.g., agriculture and non-agriculture), the harmonized variable `industcat`, which is a categorical variable for industrial sectors, would only have two values in all datasets. This approach guarantees that all the variables are fully comparable, but it suffers from loss of information. Imagine, for example, that a single survey in the SARMD collection only has these two categories for industrial sectors while all the other surveys have five or more. If that were the case, the `industcat` ex-post harmonized variable would not capture all the valuable information on industrial sectors across countries. On the other hand, the benchmark approach refers to harmonizing each variable according to a previously established ideal definition. At the beginning of the project, it could be agreed that the ideal number of industrial sectors should be ten (1 agriculture, 2 mining, 3 manufacturing, etc.). It would not matter whether any of the surveys has ten categories for industrial sectors. If some of them have more, then it would be necessary to aggregate some of the categories into broader ones. If some of them have less categories than ten, it might not be possible to disaggregate some of these categories into smaller ones. 

As you can imagine, no approach to harmonization is perfect. However, SARMD follows the *benchmark approach*. The main reason for choosing this approach is that household surveys get better over time, and the minimum common denominator approach applied to both old and new surveys would inevitably drag down the content of SARMD to the old surveys' methodological structure. In contrast, the benchmark approach takes advantage of the structure of new surveys. Once the benchmark does not reflect the features of newer surveys, there is always room for updating and refining the ideal definition of a variable and readapting old surveys to it. 

Despite the disadvantages of ex--post harmonization, harmonized variables in SARMD may be used for research purposes in a lot of ways. For example, household access to at least one bicycle (Yes=1, No=0) is averaged at a subnational (state or province) level and plotted in a map for the most recent survey available in each country. Even though survey characteristics vary, and data comes from different years, having access to a bicycle seems to be significantly more common for households in Eastern India than in other areas of South Asia. These Tableau dashboards may be accessed by clicking on them and modified by using the filters provided, which allows the user to explore SARMD and learn what kind of data is available to study household welfare in South Asia.

This book provides the user of SARMD a complete understanding of the harmonization of variables in three main areas:

**Part 1** presents the metadata analysis of SARMD, which may be broadly described as an overview of the household survey questionnaires and other survey characteristics. This part studies the household surveysâ€™ raw data, sampling methodology, coverage, data capturing methods, and ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures. 

**Part 2** presents the harmonized variables in SARMD. We inspect the quality of these harmonized variables and verify that each harmonized variable has been constructed properly. Two kinds of quality checks of the harmonized data have been conducted. A *static quality check* evaluates the coherence of each variable and its consistency with the rest of the variables in the dataset. At the individual level, for example, the variable `age`, which refers to the age of the individual, might be required to pass the following quality checks:

* It should not have negative values (internal coherence)
* All of its values should fall within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-120)[^agespam]
* The number of years working or years of education should not be greater than `age` (internal consistency with other variables).

At the household level, for example, a high number of households that report having access to a television while not having access to electricity may raise questions on whether these variables were harmonized correctly or whether the inconsistency comes from the raw data. 

On the other hand, a *dynamic quality check* evaluates the inconsistencies in measurement of harmonized data and provides a better overview on whether categorical variables have changed over time. In this section, changes in poverty and inequality measures are also analyzed over time. 

**Part 3** presents a set of socioeconomic findings at the regional level using SARMD. Each of these findings is a brief example of the potential analyses that may be conducted using SARMD. These examples provide the Stata code that may be used to replicate the results. That way, users become more familiar with SARMD and may use these pieces of code as starting points for their own projects. 

[^agespam]: Even though it is possible to find in surveys people older than 120 years, it is not only unlikely, but also problematic for anonymization.
