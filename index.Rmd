This book is about the analysis of household surveys from South Asian countries and is intended to be used as a manual by any researcher interested in using the South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD). The household surveys contained in SARMD provide a rich and open source of data on economic behavior and expenditure patterns, demographics, educational attainment, employment, the acquisition of durable assets, and housing. The harmonization of these surveys allows to compare social and economic statistics among the eight countries in the region.
