This book is the user guidelines of the South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD); a collection of harmonizaed household surveys in the South Asia Region (SAR) that is used as underlying data for estimating comparable socieconomic indicators at the country and regional levels in SAR. In addition, SARMD is used in the Global Monitorind Database, a global comparable microdata across countries, regions and years for global poverty monitoring and welfare measurement hosted by the World Bank. The household surveys contained in SARMD provide a rich environment on expenditure patterns, demographics, educational attainment, employment, the acquisition of durable assets, and housing. The harmonization of these surveys allows to compare social and economic statistics among the eight countries in the region.

These guidelines are intended to teach you everything you need to work efficiently with SARMD. You will learn how to access the microdata through the `datalibweb` system and how to perform basic (and not so basic) socioeconomic calculations. We will study how comparable household surveys are across the region and evaluate the quality of the harmonization process. We also provide several examples on how to conduct analysis at the regional or country level in our analytical notes. 

## Team {-}

This book has been created by the South Asia Region Team for Statistical Development (SARTSD) under the direction of Benu Bidani. The team is composed by Raúl Andrés Castañeda Aguilar, Jayne Jungsun Yoo, and Francisco Javier Parada Gómez Urquiza. We are greatful for the comments and suggestions made by... 

## Replicability {-}

This book is fully replicable. All the text files, codes, underlying data, and Tableau dashboards can be found in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/worldbank/SARMD_guidelines). You are allowed to download and use any of the files in the repository, but please keep in mind that all the files---in particular the code---contained in this book are simultaneously available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This means that you are free to use them in your own projects, as long as you cite the source.

## How to read this book {#how-to-read .unnumbered}

This book is not intended to be read from cover to cover. We present each chapter independent from each other; yet we added some cross reference along the book for clarification and expansion of certain topics. The book is divided into four main topics:

*	**Basic information** on how to use SARMD through datalibweb and basic understanding of poverty in the SAR. 
*	**Metadata analysis**. This section contains a clear understanding of the SARMD inventory and the different components of the consumption aggregate (i.e., food, non-food, durables, and housing) in all the surveys of the region
*	**Quality check**. This section summarizes the quality of the raw data and the harmonization. Even though several dashboards have been built to showcase the information, we are still working on the writeups in the chapters. 
*	**Analytical notes**. Here we present about five (hopefully eight) analytical notes of socioeconomic findings at the regional level using SARMD. This notes could be easily converted into blogs. 

In addition, many of the graphs in this book are interactive Tableau dashboards. Figure \@ref(fig:bicyclef), for isntance, is an example of these dashboards. You may visualize the share of households with access to a certain asset at a subnational level. You may change access to `bicycle` to access to a `computer` or `cellphone` by using the filters provided. You may also switch to a different category of variables such as demographic or education variables. The filters allow the user to explore SARMD and learn what kind of data is available to study household welfare.

## About the technical composition of this book {-}

This book is written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) syntax and compiled with the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package. The source files are available in the World Bank Github repository [worldbank/SARMD_guidelines](https://github.com/worldbank/SARMD_guidelines). To become a contributor to this project, please send an email to ... requesting for access. Once you are granted access, you may clone or fork this repository and start contributing. 

There are several advantages to composing books (especially technical books) using Markdown:

1. You can create different types of output formats such as PDF, HTML, WORD, EPub, and even Kindle files. 
2. Everything is written using plain text, so you may enjoy the benefits of tracking changes through collaborative platforms as Git. 
3. You can execute `R` or `Stata` code directly from the text, include code chunks, and present its corresponding results inline wherever you want within the document. 
4. You can add features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and import [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) styles to create elegant and beautiful books.


## Software information and conventions {-}

All the pieces of code are written `like this` and sometimes you may find chunks of code like this:

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
This is a chunk of code,
and everything in it may be copied and
pasted directly into the corresponding
execution console, which could be 
Stata or R.
```

Most of the code chunks in this book are written in `Stata` syntax, but you may find some pieces of code written in `R` language as well.  

The R session information used when this book was compiled is the following:

```{r session}
sessionInfo()
```
