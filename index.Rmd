# Welcome

The region of **South Asia** consists of eight countries for which there is at least satisfactory data
availability. Even though the region does not lack data, it suffers from **low frequency and comparability
over time and across countries**. The main welfare measure used in the region to measure poverty, the
consumption per capita aggregate, is constructed by adding up expenditures of four expenditure components:

(i) food expenditures; 
(ii) non-food, non-durable expenditures; 
(iii) expenditures on durables; and
(iv) expenditures on housing. 

This document offers a series of guidelines to any researcher interested in
working with regionally-comparable estimates of demographic characteristics, education, housing, and
poverty incidence provided by the South Asia Micro Database (SARMD).
