# Child Marriage in SAR {#note-childmarriage}
***

Child Marriage refers to formal marriages and informal unions of a girl or boy before the age of 18. Child marriage affects both girls and boys, but it mostly occurs among girls especially in South Asia. According to UNICEF, South Asia accounts for almost half of global child marriage. India and Bangladesh belong to top 10 countries with highest rate of child marriage. Almost half of all women aged 20-24 years reported being married before the age of 18. Bangladesh has the highest rate of child brides who are under 15 and the second highest rate of child marriage globally. About 74 percent of women currently aged 20-49 in the country were married before they turned 18.

Many girls aged between 15 and 19 in the region have been forced to get married as child brides due to poverty and cultural norms, leading many of them to encounter heath hazard, low education and even domestic violence. In delaying or preventing child marriages, improvment in quality and access of education has been widely emphasized. Higher education helps girls to participate in labor markets to earn income and empowers them to claim their rights in a society, reducing the chance of getting married early.

It is already well known that more educated girls are less likely to be in the danger of child or early marriage. However, decisions to send children as child brides are made by adults in households. This highlights that education and gender perspectives among household members are crucial in eliminating child marriage. The findings from SARMD provide evidence that having educated women in a family can effecively prevent early marriage among girls in their housholds. 

We constructed an indicator for early marriage based on demographic variables including martial status, age, and relationship to head. After adding married girls under age 18, we found women aged between 20 and 24 who have children at least aged 1. Following STATA code allows to create the early marriage indicator based on the harmonized variables.

Then we tabulated the share of households with girls married early by gender and highest education level among adult household members older than 24. This is to prevent the inclusion of current early marrige in households. We do not have information on whether other female adults were married before 18. Comparing the distribution of the share of education attainment among female and male adults can provide evidence on how education can differently impact the reduction in child marriage by gender.

```

The figure above shows that highest education level among female household members is more associated with the incidence of child marriage than that among male members. For example, in India, female members in 80 percent of housholds with child marriage did not receive any education while 42.4 percent of child those households have male members who finished secondary school. In other words, if a household has a female member who completed secondary school, the incidence of child marriage drastically falls down compared to the housholds with uneducated women. When only male household memebrs are considered, education attainment and the share of child marriage are positively correlated upto secondary education level in most countries in South Asia. 

Further analysis should be followed to derive causal relationship between the impact of education on child marriage. However, the drastic differenc in the incidence of child marriage between households with non-educated and educated women implies that education may have large impact on overall perspectives on child marriage.
