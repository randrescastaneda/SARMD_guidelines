# Child Marriage in SAR
***

Child Marriage refers to formal marriages and informal unions of a girl or boy before the age of 18. Child marriage affects both girls and boys, but it mostly occurs among girls especially in South Asia. Many girls aged between 15 and 19 in the region have been forced to get married as child brides due to poverty and cultural norms, leading many of them to encounter heath hazard, lowe education and even domestic violence. 

According to UNICEF, the region accounts for almost half of global child marriage. Bangladesh has the highest rate of child brides who are under the age of 15. Bangladesh is also ranked second globally in terms of the rate of child marriages, where 74 percent of women currently aged 20-49 were married before they turned 18. South Asia has the highest rates of child marriage in the world. India and Bangladesh belong to top 10 countries with highest rate of child marriage. Almost half of all women aged 20-24 years reported being married before the age of 18.

Improving education has been emphasized as a key to further delaying or preventing child marriages. Higher education helps girls to participate in labor markets to earn income and empowers them to clain their rights in society. However, the findings from SARMD may provide evidence that educated women can effecively prevent early marriage in their housholds. 

In obtaining the finding, we construct an indicator for early marriage ased on relevant demographic variables including martial status, age, and relationship to head. We first include married girls under age 18 and find women aged 24 or less who have children at least aged between 1 to 4. 

```stata
* Example: Creating a variable for early/child marriage

* Open dataset
datalibweb, country(`country') year(`year') type(SARMD) surveyid(`surveyid') clear 

* Generate child marriage
gen earlym=(age<18&male==0&marital!=2&marital!=.)
replace earlym=. if marital==.

gen child=age if relationharm==3
bys countrycode year idh: egen childage=max(child)
 
gen earlym_all=((age<=18&age<=20&male==0&relationharm<3&childage>1)|	///
				(age==21&male==0&relationharm<3&childage>2)|	///
				(age==23&male==0&relationharm<3&childage>3)|	///
				(age==24&male==0&relationharm<3&childage>4))|	///
				earlym==1
```

It is already well known that more educated girls are less likely to be in the danger of child or early marriage. However, decisions to send children as child brides are made by adults in households. This highlights that education and gender perspectives among household members are crucial in eliminating child marriage.

```{r NoteCdash1,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Early Marriage and Education Level of Household Members", out.height='10%', fig.align = 'left'}

```

The figure above shows that highest education level among female household members is more associated with the incidence of child marriage than that among male members. For example, in India, female members in 80 percent of housholds with child marriage did not receive any education while 42.4 percent of child those households have male members who finished secondary school. In other words, if a household has a female member who completed secondary school, the incidence of child marriage drastically falls down compared to the housholds with uneducated women but this pattern is the opposite for male members in most countries in South Asia. 

Further analysis should be followed to derive causal relationship between the impact of education on child marriage. However, highly negative correlation between the level of education among female members and child marriage suggests the importance of education.
