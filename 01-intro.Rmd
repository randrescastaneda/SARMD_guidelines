The South Asia Region Monitoring Database (SARMD) is a regional database of socio-economic indicators established in 2014 and managed by the South Asia Region Team for Statistical Development (SARTSD). It consists of raw household survey data, documentation, questionnaires, and a repository of do files to reconstruct harmonized variables, consumption aggregates, and poverty estimates. SARMD currently includes the eight countries in the region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), contemplates forty-three surveys, and contains close to a hundred harmonized variables covering the 1993-2017 period.

The SARMD follows the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) harmonization guidelines, including the construction of the welfare aggregate used for global poverty monitoring. However, given that the GMD encompasses a limited numbers of variables, the SARMD collection provides the users with a larger set of harmonized variables that---though not avaialable for comparability with countries from other regions---are comparable across the countries of the South Asia Region.As the GMD expands, new variables would be incorporated into SARMD until both datasers are identical and users can be referred to GMD only.

Harmonization facilitates the use of household data at a regional leve because all the databases in the SARMD collection have a common set of XX variables with the same names, variable labels and value labels. Technically speaking, the SARMD is not a harmonization in the sense that each variable in each dataset refers to the very same thing. For instance, even though variable `welfare` refers to the per capita welfare aggregate used to calculated official poverty rates and inequality indicators, it may include imputed rents in some countries (e.g., Bhutan or Bangladesh) but not in others (e.g., India or Afghanistan). This is so because the questionnaires, sample frames, recollection period, and several other factors make a strict harmonization, and hence perfect comparability, impossible across countries.

A second best to perfect comparability across countries is known as  *ex--post* harmonization, which refers to a harmonization effort starting from non-harmonized raw data. Two main approaches can be taken on *ex--post* harmonization: [1] minimum common denominator approach and [2] benchmark approach. The former refers to harmonize variables according to the minimum common set of characteristics that all datasets share with respect to one variable. For example, if the minimum number of working sectors common to all countries is two (e.g., aggriculture and non-aggriculture), then 
However, the SARMD is still considered an *ex--post* harmonization in the sense that each variable of this collection has a particular definition that works as benchamark.    that is  but rather a standardization of data characteristics.  We provide a few examples on how the harmonized variables in SARMD may be used for research purposes. For example, household access to at least one bicycle (Yes=1, No=0) is averaged at a subnational (state or province) level and plotted in a map for the most recent survey available in each country.  Even though survey characteristics vary and data comes from different years, having access to a bicycle seems to be significantly more common for households in Eastern India than in other areas of South Asia. These Tableau dashboards may be accessed by clicking on them and modified by using the filters provided, which allows the user to explore SARMD and learn what kind of data is available to study household welfare in South Asia.

This book provides the user of SARMD a complete understanding of the harmonization in three main areas:

**Part 1** presents the metadata analysis of the SARMD, which may be broadly described as an overview of the household survey questionnaires and other survey characteristics. This part studies the household surveysâ€™ raw data, sampling methodology, coverage, data capturing methods, and ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures. 

**Part 2** presents the harmonized variables in the South Asia Micro Database (SARMD). We inspect the quality of these harmonized variables and verify that each harmonized variable has been constructed properly. Two kinds of quality checks of the harmonized data have been conducted. A *static quality check* evaluates the coherence of each variable and its consistency with the rest of the variables in the dataset. At the individual level, let's take variable `age` as an example. This variable, which simply refers to the age of the individual, might be required to pass the following quality checks:

* It should not have negative values. (internal coherence)
* All its values should fall within a reasonable age spam (e.g., 0-120).[^agespam]
* Number of working years should not be greater than `age`. (internal consistency with other variables).

At the household level, for example, households that report access to a television and, at the same time, do not have access to electricity may raise questions on whether these variables were harmonized correctly or whether the inconsistency comes from the raw data. 

On the other hand, a *dynamic quality check* evaluates the inconsistencies in measurement of harmonized data and provides a better overview on whether categorical variables have changed over time. Changes in poverty and inequality measures are also analyzed over time. 

**Part 3** presents a set of socieconomic findings at the regional level using SARMD. Each of the findings in this seciton is just a small example of all the possible analyses that can be done with SARMD. One of the main value added of these examples is the they come with the Stata code used to replicate the results. In this way, we expect the user gets not only familiar with SARMD, but also uses these pieces of code as starting points for their own projects.
