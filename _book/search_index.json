The following Tableau dashboard displays which variables are currently available for each household survey. The different colors indicate a variable’s percentage of missing values. Figure 7.1: SARMD Availability and missing observations 7.1 Basic survey characteristics (#fig:boxes_and_circles)Basic survey characteristics The essential variables that identify each dataset and individual within a household are countrycode, year, survey, vermast, veralt, idh, and idp. Weights are defined as wgt and pop_wgt=wgtxhsize. The dates of the survey are recorded as int_year and int_month. The geographical location within the country’s administrative division is recorded as subnatid1, and in some cases, subnatid2 may provide a more specific location. Unfortunately, the variables psu and strata are only available for a few surveys. The same is true for the spatial deflator spdef. 7.2 Demographic variables There are currently six essential demographic variables in SARMD: age, hsize, male, relationcs, relationharm and marital. 7.2.1 age The youngest country in the region is Afghanistan. The oldest is Sri Lanka. 7.2.2 hsize Household size is close to seven in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Maldives, and much closer to 4-5 in the rest of the countries. The following dashboard shows how average household size declines as we move to higher quintiles of per capita expenditures. Average household size is 9.66 in the poorest per capita expenditure quintile of Afghanistan, compared to 3.91 in the richest per capita expenditure quintile of Sri Lanka. Having more children (individuals &lt; 15 years old) is negatively correlated with household per capita expenditures. We would expect higher poverty rates among large households and households with more children. 7.2.3 male Sex ratio is used to describe the number of females per 1000 of males. In India, and some other countries in South Asia, this ratio may be heavily skewed towards men. 7.2.4 relationcs This variable refers to the original categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head. They change from survey to survey and may include categories as: Household Head Husband/Wife Son/Daughter Grandchildren Grandfather/Grandmother Father or mother Father-in-law/Mother-in-law Brother or sister Brother-in-law/sister-in-law Nephew or niece Domestic servants Employee Other family relative Unrelated member 7.2.5 relationharm This variable refers to the simplified categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head: Household Head Spouse Children Parents Other relatives Non-relatives 7.2.6 marital This variable classifies individuals according to their marital status into these simplified categories: Never Married Married Divorced/separated Widowed Living Together Population pyramids such as the one provided in Figure ?? allow to see how countries’ demographics change over time while showing whether the marital status of individuals has been harmonized adequately. About 63.7 percent of Afghans are under 25 years of age, reflecting a steep pyramid age structure. 7.3 Education There are currently eight essential education variables in SARMD: literacy, atschool, everattend, ed_mod_age, educy, educat4, educat5, and educat7. 7.3.1 literacy The adult literacy rate – referring to the population aged 15 and over – is an indicator that measures the accumulated achievement of the education system. The youth literacy rate – the literacy rate in the population aged 15-24 – reflects the outcomes of primary education over roughly the previous 10 years and is a measure of recent educational progress. 7.3.2 atschool Dummy variable that indicates whether individual is currently enrolled in school. 7.3.3 everattend Dummy variable that indicates whether individual has ever attended school. 7.3.4 ed_mod_age Minimum age level at which the education module of the questionnaire is applied. 7.3.5 educy Number of years of education of an individual. Should not include pre-school. 7.3.6 educat4 Education categories divided into four groups. 7.3.7 educat5 Education categories divided into five groups. 7.3.8 educat7 Education categories divided into seven groups. 7.4 Durable assets This section analyzes whether the sixteen asset variables in SARMD have been adequately harmonized and may be used for research purposes. These binary variables (Yes=1, No=0) represent whether households have access to a particular durable asset. The variables are defined at the household level and do not represent whether each individual owns an asset in particular, but whether the household as a whole has access to it. The harmonization of these asset variables is limited by their availability in the household questionnaire. For example, cow, chicken, and buffalo cannot be harmonized if a survey does not cover live-stocking activities. It may also be that some of these assets are unnecessary (a fan in cold weather), obsolete (land phone), or too basic (lamp) to be included in a questionnaire. Quality checks were conducted to make sure that these variables could only be equal to 0 or 1. We also verified that the value was the same within each household. A deeper look at these asset variables allowed to identify some interesting trends. Figure 7.2 displays the percentage of households that have access to an asset by country for the latest survey round available. It shows that cellphones are the most accessible assets and that there can be a wide range between the minimum and the maximum. Figure 7.2: Harmonized asset ownership in latest household survey round see Figure 7.2 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Assets Figure 7.3: Access to refrigerator and access to electricity across surveys see Figure 7.3 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Scatter Figure 7.3 shows a clear exponential trend between the percentage of households that have access to electricity and the percentage of households that have access to a refrigerator. A similar relationship with electricity was found for television, washing machine, and fan. A quality check was conducted to identify the number of observations where the household had no access to electricity, but still had access to an asset. In some cases, it might seem illogical, for example, for a household to own a television if it does not have access to electricity. In Afghanistan (2013), 7,771 out of 20,773 households seemed to have a television and no electricity. However, a mistake in the harmonization process was identified and this number was reduced to 3,119 out of 20,773 households once the mistake was fixed. Still, 13-20% of observations in Afghanistan have consistently reported having a television and no electricity. 7.5 Housing The living conditions of the Afghan population are to a large extent determined by the conditions of housing, including facilities for drinking water and sanitation. Most people – 83 percent – live in dwellings that are constructed with non-durable materials and 44 percent live in conditions of overcrowding, meaning that there are more than three persons per room. The large majority of urban dwellers – 72 percent – live in slums or inadequate housing. 7.6 Labor 7.7 Welfare 7.7.1 Poverty This section presents the latest data on regional extreme poverty rates using the international poverty line of US$1.90 in 2011 purchasing power parity dollars. Even though, Afghanistan is missing, the ALCS 2016-17 recorded a sharp deterioration in welfare of the Afghan population. The proportion of population living below the national poverty line increased from 34 percent in 2007-08 to 55 percent in 2016-17. The latest poverty figures imply that at the time of the survey, close to 16 million Afghans lived in poverty. Urban poverty lower than rural poverty. datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(GMD) mod(ALL) vermast(01) veralt(02) surveyid(PSLM) gen welf_ppp = welfare/cpi2011/icp2011/365 gen poor190 = welf_ppp &lt; 1.9 sum poor190 [aw=weight_h] 7.7.2 Inequality The Gini index for Afghanistan showed a small decrease between the surveys of 2011-12 and 2016-17, from 0.30 to 0.29.
