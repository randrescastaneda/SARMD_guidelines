This chapter studies the household surveys’ raw data, sampling methodology, coverage, data capturing methods, and ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures. Chapter 2 presents the harmonized variables in the South Asia Micro Database (SARMD). We inspect the quality of these harmonized variables and verify that each harmonized variable has been constructed properly. Two kinds of quality checks of the harmonized data have been conducted. A static quality check evaluates whether the harmonized variables are present and whether there is a high percentage of missing values. It also delves deeper into variables that may be interrelated with other variables. For example, a high percentage of households that have access to a television, but do not have access to electricity may raise questions on how these variables were constructed. A dynamic quality check evaluates the inconsistencies in measurement of harmonized data over time. It provides a better overview on whether categorical variables have changed over time. Changes in poverty and inequality measures are also analyzed over time. Chapter 3 presents some examples of how harmonized data in SARMD may be used for research purposes. Introduction to poverty measurement According to the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018), Nigeria may already have overtaken India as the country with the most extreme poor in the world. Still, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, progress in poverty reduction needs to continue in India and the rest of South Asia. Despite a poverty rate of 13.4 percent, India’s large population of 1.3 billion results in a high absolute number of poor (approximately 170 million poor people in 2015). In 2015, South Asia accounted for 29% of the people living in extreme poverty worldwide (213 million extreme poor in South Asia out of the estimated 736 million extreme poor worldwide). In the South Asia region, four out of five extreme poor reside in India. Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, but its large population still maintains it in second place within the region in terms of absolute number of poor. Sri Lanka and Bhutan are considered development success stories where extreme poverty has become rare, although a large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the extreme poverty line. Pakistan saw a consistent and significant decline in poverty over the 14 years from 2001 to 2015. Even as much of the region leaves extreme poverty behind, poverty is becoming more entrenched and harder to root out in certain areas, particularly in countries burdened by violent conflict and weak institutions. Nepal experienced devastating earthquakes in 2015 and remains predominantly rural, with the highest share of labor force in agriculture (73%) in the region as of 2016. The Maldives were devastated by the 2004 tsunami while its tourism industry is seriously threatened by climate change. In the case of Afghanistan, poverty is increasing as violence continues to affect the security of livelihoods and economic activity in the country. The World Bank’s poverty measures for South Asia provided by PovcalNet are shown in the following figure. PovcalNet provides headcount ratios, poverty gaps, squared poverty gaps, Gini coefficients, among other measures. Poverty measurement methodology The World Bank set a target of reducing extreme poverty to less than 3 percent by 2030 and to ensure continued focus and steady progress toward the goal, the institution set an interim target of 9 percent by 2020. Progress towards this goal is measured by monitoring the share of the global population living below the international poverty line, currently set at US$1.90 in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars. All eight countries in South Asia measure the international extreme poverty status of an individual by comparing consumption expenditures per capita against this poverty line. This book overviews the data availability of household consumption surveys in the region of South Asia and their challenges for poverty measurement. The starting point in monitoring progress in poverty reduction and enhancing shared prosperity in the region is to have household consumption survey data that are not only available at reasonably frequent intervals, but are also comparable over time (Serajuddin et al. (2015)). Spatial and temporal adjustments are necessary to take into account differences in costs of living. First, a consumer price index (CPI) is necessary to measure by how much the general price level in a country has changed over time. Deflating all nominal expenditures to real expenditures allows to ensure that welfare comparisons between two periods are not being driven by inflation. Second, spatial price differences, typically between urban and rural areas, can also be large and it is important to take them into account. In South Asia, price levels for rural households are often lower than for urban households. The ideal way to control for spatial differences in prices is to use a Paasche or Laspeyres index to account for differences in the cost of living across space. Third, it is necessary to convert expenditures to a common currency taking into account purchasing power. At present, data on purchasing power parity (PPP) comes from the International Comparison Program (ICP) collected in 2011, which is absent for Afghanistan. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalise the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. In their simplest form, PPPs show the ratio of prices in national currencies of the same good or service in different countries. PPPs are also calculated for groups of products and for each of the various levels of aggregation up to and including GDP. The basket of goods and services priced is a sample of all those that are a part of final expenditure: household consumption, government services, capital formation and net exports, covered by GDP. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per US dollar. Country Currency ICP 2011 Afghanistan Afghan afghani 17.72? Bangladesh Bangladeshi taka 24.8493 Bhutan Bhutanese ngultrum 16.96292 India Indian rupee 13.98707 Maldives Maldivian rufiyaa 10.67606 Nepal Nepalese rupee 25.75928 Pakistan Pakistani rupee 25.41426 Sri Lanka Sri Lankan rupee 42.21894 A fourth adjustment is dividing total household expenditure by some measure of the number of people in the household, and to assign the resulting per capita welfare measure to each household member as an individual. Later in the applications, we show how larger households typically have lower per capita expenditure levels than smaller households. In South Asia, the consequences of dividing total household expenditures by a greater number of individuals would not be complete without considering the extent of economies of scale within the household and a discussion of how much children and the elderly typically consume compared to adults.
