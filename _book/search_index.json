In this chapter, we present the results of a Metadata analysis focusing mostly on the household surveys’ ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures with different data collection methods. 5.1 Food The first component is food expenditures, which should include not only food produced and/or consumed at home, but also food purchases outside of home, and food transfers to and from the household. This component is sometimes thought to be easier to measure than non-food items. When household members eat from a common pot, it is common to find a single well-informed individual who can act as respondent and provide information about how much the household has consumed. Household surveys sometimes include a food expenditure diary, but this is not common in South Asia where most information on food is collected based on recalling what a household has consumed and purchased over the last seven days. The ideal reference period should be a week, but in this analysis we have found reference periods still vary from yearly, to monthly, to biweekly, to daily across surveys. In recent years, the Indian National Sample Survey Organization has experimented with 7-day and 30-day recall periods for a number of items, and discovered that the 7-day recall cuts Indian poverty rates by half, removing some 200 million people from dollar-a-day poverty. This is an issue that has not been much investigated, but has recently moved into the forefront of research. In other words, methods matter and it is important to standardize data collection as much as possible. In most cases, countries modify their food baskets and change their data collection methods over time. A wide mixture of data collection methods characterizes the most recent rounds of household surveys. Bangladesh HIES 2016 collects daily household food consumption (both quantity and value) for a period of 14 days. In addition, it collects weekly consumption of a series of spices. Bhutan LSS 2017 collects food consumption (both quantity and value) by asking the respondent to recall their consumption in the last seven days, the last thirty days, and the last year. In some cases, such as Afghanistan LCS 2016, the female respondents are the ones asked about household food consumption. These methods can be very diverse and we provide a brief description for the latest survey available for each country in Table 5.1. TABLE 5.1: Mixture of collection methods for food at home Country, Year Number of food items Collection method Quantity and/or Value Afghanistan, 2016 92 Recall (weekly) Quantity Bangladesh, 2016 151 Diary (daily) Both Bhutan, 2017 115 Recall (weekly, monthly, yearly) Both India, 2011 134 Recall (multiple) Both Maldives, 2016 146 Recall (weekly) Both Nepal, 2015 97 Recall (weekly) Both Pakistan, 2015 170 Recal (biweekly) Both Sri Lanka, 2016 198 Recall (weekly) Both Food is composed of all edible goods that are purchased and consumed by the household with the purpose of nourishing. Food baskets are usually organized by categories into: Cereals and cereal products; Meat; Fish and other seafood; Milk, other dairy products and eggs; Oils and fats; Fruit and nuts; Vegetables, tubers, plantains, cooking bananas and pulses; Sugar, confectionery and desserts; Salt, sauces and condiments, spices and culinary herbs and seeds. Alcohol and tobacco are considered non-food items for measuring purposes, but it is common to find them in the food section of a questionnaire. In most surveys, households report both quantities and expenditures for most of the foods they purchase (e.g. three kilograms of rice for 5 rupees). However, this is not the norm. For example, Afghanistan LCS 2016 asks what was the amount of 92 items used in the last seven days, but the price of each item is collected separately through a market price survey. Besides food produced and consumed at home, the food component should include food consumed outside the home, both formally such as at restaurants and cafés, and informally, such as small snacks and drinks. This component is usually recorded separately and is more likely to suffer from measurement error. An agreement on how these expenditures should be recorded has not been reached. For example, Afghanistan LCS 2016 asks for the total amount spent on food and drinks outside of home in the last month. In contrast, Bhutan LSS 2017 asks how many times did the household consume food for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack, outside of home in the last 7 days and what was the average value of the purchase. Another component that is prone to measurement error is food transfers, which are currently measured unevenly with different collection methods. We have found that it is more common to find questions regarding transfers to the household than transfers from the household to other households. For example, Bhutan LSS 2017 asks what is the total value of a food item that was received as gift over the past 12 months. However, it does not ask what amount of the food item the household has transferred to others. We provide a Tableau dashboard where the user may compare surveys according to: The number of food items in the food basket Whether they collect the quantity and/or value of food consumed at home and outside of home Data collection methods (diary vs. recall) as well as their reference periods (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and/or yearly) Information on self-production Information on transfers to and from the household 5.2 Non-food The second component, non-food expenditures, includes frequently purchased goods and services like soap, cleaning supplies, newspapers, and personal care items. It also includes some less frequent but regular purchases like clothing, footwear, kitchen equipment, curtains, bedcovers, etc. In most cases, the non-food expenditures component must be constructed by aggregating expenditures on goods and services from different sections of a survey. A homogenous definition of what constitutes non-food expenditures is required. The Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) is the international reference classification for household expenditures. We define non-food expenditures as categories 2-12 of the COICOP: Food and non-alcoholic beverages Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics Clothing and footwear Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels Furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance Health Transport Information and communication Recreation, sport and culture Education services Restaurants and hotels Miscellaneous goods and services Still, each country may determine its own definition of what constitutes non-food expenditures. In Bangladesh 2016, non-food expenditures included fuel and lightning, cosmetics and hygiene items, transport and travel, ready-made garments, clothing materials, footwear, household-use textiles, health treatment expenses, housing related expenses, education, recreation and leisure. In Bhutan 2017, non-food expenditures included tobacco and doma, clothing and footwear, transport and communications, household operations, recreation, furnishings and household equipment, agricultural input and machinery, miscellaneous expenditure, educational expenses, health expenses, rental expenses, energy for the home, and remittances abroad. Similarly to what found studying the food component, non-food items are also collected for different reference periods, for example, from consumption in the last 30 days, past 3 months, or the last year. Monthly is the most frequent collection period for non-food expenditures. Both food and non-food expenditures have insufficient coverage on transfers. We provide a Tableau Dashboard where the user may compare surveys according to: The number of non-food items in the non-food basket Whether they collect the quantity and/or value of non-food items Data collection reference periods (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and/or yearly) Whether they provide information on transfers to and from the household 5.3 Durable assets The third component is consumer flows from durable assets. The consumer flows from durable assets (also referred to as user costs or rental equivalents) represent the opportunity cost of money invested in these goods taking into account their lifetime and depreciation. The most important finding regarding the collection of data on durable assets through household surveys in South Asia is that the data collection methods followed can be very different. It is expected for data collection methods to vary over time and from one country to another. However, even for items within a country’s particular survey we can find different data collection methods. For example, even though both cows and cars may be considered productive assets, the information available for these two assets within a survey may be very different and would be contained in different sections of the survey. Even for more similar goods, like a washing machine and a sewing machine, the information provided by a survey may differ. For that reason, we found it necessary to characterize each item’s data collection method separately. Data available for household assets (e.g. a car) may be different from data available for agricultural assets (e.g. a tractor). Some assets are grouped together, while others are collected individually, and some may even have their own section in the survey. This is the case for cellphones, which are durable assets, but are usually given special treatment and collected separately in the surveys. Long-lived goods (automobiles, appliances, furniture) have a positive and significant impact on living standards. These durable assets may deliver useful services to consumers through repeated use over an extended period of time. For that reason, surveys should collect data on all assets available to the household, not just the ones purchased recently. This is unfortunately the case for India 2011 and Pakistan 2015. Pakistan 2015 collects information on durable assets only if they were purchased in the last year. India 2011 collects specific details only for assets acquired in the last 30 days or in the last year. To measure the flows from using durable goods over extended periods of time, we need to know their quantity, date of purchase, and how much they cost at the time of purchase vs. their current value. Nepal AHS 2016 represents the standard practice a survey should follow. Nepal AHS 2016 asks whether the assets are available, their quantity, age, purchase and current values, and whether the assets were paid for or received as gift. Asking how many years ago was an asset acquired provides more information than asking whether the asset was purchased in the last 12 months. The most incomplete example would have to be Pakistan 2015, which focuses only on assets acquired in the last year and only measures values, not quantities. Table 5.2 provides a quick comparison between countries by presenting the number of assets collected, and their collection method (i.e. quantity and/or value). In addition, we provide a Tableau dashboard where the user may identify which surveys collect insufficient information regarding durable assets. TABLE 5.2: Durables Country, Year Number of assets Quantity Value Afghanistan, 2016 18 7 Yes Yes Yes Yes Bangladesh, 2016 27 Yes Yes Bhutan, 2017 13 9 23 No Yes Yes No No Yes India, 2011 53 Yes, but only if recently purchased Yes, but only if recently purchased Maldives, 2016 16 Yes Yes Nepal, 2016 23 Yes Yes Pakistan, 2015 67 No Yes, but only if recently purchased Sri Lanka, 2016 25 Yes Yes 5.4 Housing The fourth component is rent, which is in some cases observed directly for households who rent their house or apartment. For the rest, rent is obtained either by asking a household how much they would expect to receive each month for this house if they rented it out to someone, or by using a hedonic housing regression model based on dwelling characteristics and actual rent or house values. Therefore, there are three types of rent: Rent paid by households when they are not owners of their dwelling: i.e. How much do you pay per month? Self-reported or imputed rent by households who are owners of their dwelling: i.e. How much do you think you would have to pay if you had to rent this dwelling? Predicted rent by households who are owners of their dwelling and did not self-report their rent: i.e. How much does the hedonic regression model predict a household would have to pay for a dwelling of these characteristics? Most households in South Asia do not report values on paid rent because most households are owners of housing rather than renters. One area of South Asia where we find low levels of house ownership is Thimphu in Bhutan. According to Bhutan LSS 2017, in Thimphu, 59% of the households pay rent, while 17% of households live in rent-free dwellings. Of rent-paying households, 85% live in dwellings owned by private individuals and 14% live in housing owned by the government and by public corporations. The methodologies for a hedonic regression model vary by country. The methodology followed by Afghanistan differs from the rest of the countries in that they base their hedonic pricing model on the dwelling’s values and then convert it to a monthly rent, instead of trying to directly estimate rents. In Afghanistan, actual rent for renters is collected by asking “How much money per month does your household pay to live in this dwelling?”. However, there is a low number of renters. Self-reported rent was not included in the survey. Instead, rents are predicted by a hedonic regression model. Half of all owners in the LCS 2016 report the value of their dwelling by answering “If you were to purchase this dwelling today, how much would it cost?”. For these households, a hedonic housing model is estimated and used to predict the value of the dwelling based on the characteristics of the dwelling. A hedonic housing model relates the housing price to factors such as size, location, construction materials, etc. Separate regressions are estimated for urban, rural and tent dwellings. The actual or predicted housing values are converted to a monthly rent by imposing a relationship based on interest and depreciation rates. For ALCS 2016 a depreciation rate of 1.5 percent and an interest rate of 2.5 percent are assumed. For Bangladesh HIES 2016, the housing expenditure component may include the three types or rent depending on the homeownership status of each of the households: actual rent, imputed rent (i.e., the amount that homeowners report they would like to get if they could rent their house) or predicted rent. For households that did not report rent or self-report their rent, a predicted rent was estimated using a hedonic regression model. This regression model was estimated using the (log of) reported rent on the left-hand side and was regressed against a set of housing characteristics, including number of rooms, wall materials, access to electricity and tap water, kitchen, dining room, telephone connection, dwelling’s land size, and a vector of the 16 original strata dummy variables. The value of dwellings was collected by asking “If you want to buy or construct a dwelling just like this today, how much money would you have to pay?”, but it is not clear whether this value was used in the hedonic regression model. In the rest of the countries, households are asked for their hypothetical rental values, not for the value of their dwelling. Table 5.3 summarizes how each survey collects rent or dwelling values for households who own their dwelling. For Bhutan LSS 2017, households were asked for the amount of rent they pay for their dwelling in a month. People who own their dwelling or stay in rent-free houses were asked to estimate the monthly house rent for their dwellings. The question was “How much would you pay if you had to rent this dwelling?”. A similar question is included in the surveys Maldives HIES 2016, Nepal AHS 2016 and Sri Lanka HIES 2016. India 2011 and Pakistan 2015 still lack enough data to measure rents. TABLE 5.3: Housing Country, Year How is rent calculated for owners? Afghanistan, 2016 If you were to purchase this dwelling, how much would it cost? Bangladesh, 2016 Imputed rent; also asks If you want to buy or construct a dwelling just like this today, how much money would you have to pay? Bhutan, 2017 How much do you think you would have to pay if you had to rent this dwelling? India, 2011 NA Maldives, 2016 How much would you expect to receive each month for this house if you rented it out to someone? Nepal, 2016 If any person want to take this house in rent, how much money would have to pay? Pakistan, 2015 NA Sri Lanka, 2016 What is the estimated rent of owner-occupied house? The most relevant dwelling characteristics displayed in the following Tableau dashboard are: Rent captured by households’ reported rent or estimated by fitting a hedonic pricing model (regressing information available on housing characteristics on housing values) Type of dwelling (house, part of house, separate apartment, shared apartment) Tenure status Area of dwelling, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchen Material of the walls, roof, and floor Sources of drinking water Sanitation (access to flush toilet, pit latrine) Access to electricity Travel time to reach services Others such as access to an Internet connection "]

["introduction.html", "Introduction Complementary visualizations of this book Parts of the book", " Introduction The South Asia Regional Micro Database (SARMD) is a regional database of socioeconomic indicators established in 2014 and managed by the South Asia Region Team for Statistical Development (SARTSD). It consists of raw household survey data, documentation, questionnaires, and a repository of do files to reconstruct harmonized variables, consumption aggregates, and poverty estimates. SARMD currently includes the eight countries in the region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), contemplates forty-three surveys, and contains close to a hundred harmonized variables covering the 1993-2017 period. SARMD follows the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) harmonization guidelines, including the construction of the welfare aggregate that is used for global poverty monitoring. Given that GMD contains a limited number of variables, SARMD provides users with a larger set of harmonized variables that are comparable across the countries of the South Asia Region, though may not be comparable with countries from other regions. As GMD expands, new variables could be incorporated until users may be referred only to GMD. Harmonization facilitates the use of household data at a regional level because all the databases in SARMD have a common set of approximately 100 variables with the same variable names (for example, welfare), variable labels and value labels. Technically speaking, this does not mean that each variable in each dataset refers to the same thing. For example, even though the variable welfare refers to the per capita welfare aggregate used to calculate official poverty rates and inequality indicators, it may include imputed rents in some countries (e.g., Bhutan and Bangladesh), but not in others (e.g., India and Afghanistan). This is so because questionnaires, sample frames, recollection periods, and several other factors make a strict harmonization and perfect comparability impossible across countries. The best solution to lack of perfect comparability across countries is known as ex–post harmonization, which is a harmonization effort that starts from non-harmonized raw data. Two main approaches can be followed on ex–post harmonization: The minimum common denominator approach refers to harmonizing variables according to the minimum common set of characteristics that all datasets share with respect to one variable. For example, if the minimum number of industrial sectors common to all surveys in all countries were two (e.g., agriculture and non-agriculture), the harmonized variable industcat, which is a categorical variable for industrial sectors, would only have two values in all datasets. This approach guarantees that all the variables are fully comparable, but it suffers from loss of information. Imagine, for example, that a single survey in the SARMD collection only has these two categories for industrial sectors while all the other surveys have five or more. If that were the case, the industcat ex-post harmonized variable would not capture all the valuable information on industrial sectors across countries. The benchmark approach refers to harmonizing each variable according to a previously established ideal definition. For instance, tt the beginning of the project, it could be agreed that the ideal number of industrial sectors should be ten (1 agriculture, 2 mining, 3 manufacturing, etc.). It would not matter whether any of the surveys has ten categories for industrial sectors. If some of them have more, then it would be necessary to aggregate some of the categories into broader ones. If some of them have less categories than ten, it might not be possible to disaggregate some of these categories into smaller ones. As you may imagine, no approach to harmonization is perfect. However, SARMD follows the benchmark approach. The main reason for choosing this approach is that household surveys get better over time, and the minimum common denominator approach applied to both old and new surveys would inevitably drag down the content of SARMD to the old surveys’ methodological structure. In contrast, the benchmark approach takes advantage of the structure of new surveys. Once the benchmark stops reflecting the features of newer surveys, there is always room for updating and refining the benchmark and readapting old surveys to it. Despite the disadvantages of ex–post harmonization, harmonized variables in SARMD may be used for research purposes in a lot of ways. For example, household access to at least one bicycle (Yes=1, No=0) is averaged at a subnational (state or province) level and plotted in a map for the most recent survey available in each country. Even though survey characteristics vary, and data comes from different years, having access to a bicycle seems to be significantly more common for households in Eastern India than in other areas of South Asia. Complementary visualizations of this book Most of the graphs in this book are accompanied by interactive Tableau dashboards. As the image above, you may click on it and be redirected to a Tableau visualization that provides you with more information than the one available in this book. By clicking on them and modified by using the filters provided, which allows the user to explore SARMD and learn what kind of data is available to study household welfare in South Asia. Parts of the book This book provides the user of SARMD a complete understanding of the harmonization of variables in three main areas: Part 1 presents the metadata analysis of SARMD, which may be broadly described as an overview of the household survey questionnaires and other survey characteristics. This part studies the household surveys’ raw data, sampling methodology, coverage, data capturing methods, and ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures. Part 2 presents the harmonized variables in SARMD. The names of harmonized variables in this book are always emphasized as country, year, wgt, hsize, age, male, bicycle to help identify harmonized variables more easily. We inspect the quality of these harmonized variables and verify that each harmonized variable has been constructed properly. Two kinds of quality checks of the harmonized data have been conducted. A static quality check evaluates the coherence of each variable and its consistency with the rest of the variables in the dataset. At the individual level, for example, the variable age, which refers to the age of the individual, might be required to pass the following quality checks: It should not have negative values (internal coherence) age&gt;=0 All of its values should fall within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-120)1 0&lt;=age&lt;=120 The number of years of education of an individual educy should not be greater than age (internal consistency with other variables) educy&lt;age At the household level, for example, a high number of households that report having access to a television while not having access to electricity, that is, television==1 &amp; electricity==0, may raise questions on whether these variables were harmonized correctly or whether the inconsistency comes from the raw data. On the other hand, a dynamic quality check evaluates the inconsistencies in measurement of harmonized data and provides a better overview on whether categorical variables have changed over time. We tab the absolute and relative frequencies for the categories in categorical variables such as marital, urban, and educat7. In this section, it is also possible to see how the poverty dummy indicator used to generate extreme poverty headcounts, poor_int, changes over time. Inequality measures for welfare are also presented over time. Part 3 presents a set of socioeconomic findings at the regional level using SARMD. Each of these findings is a brief example of the potential analyses that may be conducted using SARMD. These examples provide the Stata code that may be used to replicate the results. That way, users become more familiar with SARMD and may use these pieces of code as starting points for their own projects. Even though it is possible to find in surveys people older than 120 years, it is not only unlikely, but also problematic for anonymization.↩ "]

["harmonized-variables.html", "Chapter 6 Harmonized variables 6.1 Basic survey characteristics 6.2 Demographic variables 6.3 Education 6.4 Durable assets 6.5 Housing 6.6 Labor 6.7 Welfare", " Chapter 6 Harmonized variables Harmonized variables in SARMD are organized in 7 categories: basic, demographic, education, assets, house, labor, and welfare. The following Tableau dashboard displays which variables are currently available for each household survey. The different colors indicate a variable’s percentage of missing values. 6.1 Basic survey characteristics The essential variables that identify each dataset and individual within a household are countrycode, year, survey, vermast, veralt, idh, and idp. Weights are defined as wgt and pop_wgt=wgtxhsize. The dates of the survey are recorded as int_year and int_month. The geographical location within the country’s administrative division is recorded as subnatid1, and in some cases, subnatid2 may provide a more specific location. Unfortunately, the variables psu and strata are only available for a few surveys. The same is true for the spatial deflator spdef. 6.2 Demographic variables There are currently six essential demographic variables in SARMD: age, hsize, male, relationcs, relationharm and marital. 6.2.1 age The youngest country in the region is Afghanistan. The oldest is Sri Lanka. 6.2.2 hsize Household size is close to seven in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Maldives, and much closer to 4-5 in the rest of the countries. The following dashboard shows how average household size declines as we move to higher quintiles of per capita expenditures. Average household size is 9.66 in the poorest per capita expenditure quintile of Afghanistan, compared to 3.91 in the richest per capita expenditure quintile of Sri Lanka. Having more children (individuals &lt; 15 years old) is negatively correlated with household per capita expenditures. We would expect higher poverty rates among large households and households with more children. 6.2.3 male Sex ratio is used to describe the number of females per 1000 of males. In India, and some other countries in South Asia, this ratio may be heavily skewed towards men. 6.2.4 relationcs This variable refers to the original categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head. They change from survey to survey and may include categories as: Household Head Husband/Wife Son/Daughter Grandchildren Grandfather/Grandmother Father or mother Father-in-law/Mother-in-law Brother or sister Brother-in-law/sister-in-law Nephew or niece Domestic servants Employee Other family relative Unrelated member 6.2.5 relationharm This variable refers to the simplified categories that indicate the relationship of an individual to the household head: Household Head Spouse Children Parents Other relatives Non-relatives 6.2.6 marital This variable classifies individuals according to their marital status into these simplified categories: Never Married Married Divorced/separated Widowed Living Together Population pyramids such as the one provided in Figure ?? allow to see how countries’ demographics change over time while showing whether the marital status of individuals has been harmonized adequately. About 63.7 percent of Afghans are under 25 years of age, reflecting a steep pyramid age structure. 6.3 Education There are currently eight essential education variables in SARMD: literacy, atschool, everattend, ed_mod_age, educy, educat4, educat5, and educat7. 6.3.1 literacy The adult literacy rate – referring to the population aged 15 and over – is an indicator that measures the accumulated achievement of the education system. The youth literacy rate – the literacy rate in the population aged 15-24 – reflects the outcomes of primary education over roughly the previous 10 years and is a measure of recent educational progress. 6.3.2 atschool Dummy variable that indicates whether individual is currently enrolled in school. 6.3.3 everattend Dummy variable that indicates whether individual has ever attended school. 6.3.4 ed_mod_age Minimum age level at which the education module of the questionnaire is applied. 6.3.5 educy Number of years of education of an individual. Should not include pre-school. 6.3.6 educat4 Education categories divided into four groups. 6.3.7 educat5 Education categories divided into five groups. 6.3.8 educat7 Education categories divided into seven groups. 6.4 Durable assets This section analyzes whether the sixteen asset variables in SARMD have been adequately harmonized and may be used for research purposes. These binary variables (Yes=1, No=0) represent whether households have access to a particular durable asset. The variables are defined at the household level and do not represent whether each individual owns an asset in particular, but whether the household as a whole has access to it. The harmonization of these asset variables is limited by their availability in the household questionnaire. For example, cow, chicken, and buffalo cannot be harmonized if a survey does not cover live-stocking activities. It may also be that some of these assets are unnecessary (a fan in cold weather), obsolete (land phone), or too basic (lamp) to be included in a questionnaire. Quality checks were conducted to make sure that these variables could only be equal to 0 or 1. We also verified that the value was the same within each household. A deeper look at these asset variables allowed to identify some interesting trends. Figure 6.1 displays the percentage of households that have access to an asset by country for the latest survey round available. It shows that cellphones are the most accessible assets and that there can be a wide range between the minimum and the maximum. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./figures/Assets.png&quot;) FIGURE 6.1: Harmonized asset ownership in latest household survey round see Figure 6.1 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Assets knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./figures/Scatter.png&quot;) FIGURE 6.2: Access to refrigerator and access to electricity across surveys see Figure 6.2 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Scatter Figure 6.2 shows a clear exponential trend between the percentage of households that have access to electricity and the percentage of households that have access to a refrigerator. A similar relationship with electricity was found for television, washing machine, and fan. A quality check was conducted to identify the number of observations where the household had no access to electricity, but still had access to an asset. In some cases, it might seem illogical, for example, for a household to own a television if it does not have access to electricity. In Afghanistan (2013), 7,771 out of 20,773 households seemed to have a television and no electricity. However, a mistake in the harmonization process was identified and this number was reduced to 3,119 out of 20,773 households once the mistake was fixed. Still, 13-20% of observations in Afghanistan have consistently reported having a television and no electricity. 6.5 Housing The living conditions of the Afghan population are to a large extent determined by the conditions of housing, including facilities for drinking water and sanitation. Most people – 83 percent – live in dwellings that are constructed with non-durable materials and 44 percent live in conditions of overcrowding, meaning that there are more than three persons per room. The large majority of urban dwellers – 72 percent – live in slums or inadequate housing. 6.6 Labor 6.7 Welfare 6.7.1 Poverty This section presents the latest data on regional extreme poverty rates using the international poverty line of US$1.90 in 2011 purchasing power parity dollars. Even though, Afghanistan is missing, the ALCS 2016-17 recorded a sharp deterioration in welfare of the Afghan population. The proportion of population living below the national poverty line increased from 34 percent in 2007-08 to 55 percent in 2016-17. The latest poverty figures imply that at the time of the survey, close to 16 million Afghans lived in poverty. Urban poverty lower than rural poverty. datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(GMD) mod(ALL) vermast(01) veralt(02) surveyid(PSLM) gen welf_ppp = welfare/cpi2011/icp2011/365 gen poor190 = welf_ppp &lt; 1.9 sum poor190 [aw=weight_h] 6.7.2 Inequality The Gini index for Afghanistan showed a small decrease between the surveys of 2011-12 and 2016-17, from 0.30 to 0.29.

Two main approaches can be followed on ex–post harmonization: The minimum common denominator approach refers to harmonizing variables according to the minimum common set of characteristics that all datasets share with respect to one variable. For example, if the minimum number of industrial sectors common to all surveys in all countries were two (e.g., agriculture and non-agriculture), the harmonized variable industcat, which is a categorical variable for industrial sectors, would only have two values in all datasets. This approach guarantees that all the variables are fully comparable, but it suffers from loss of information. Imagine, for example, that a single survey in the SARMD collection only has these two categories for industrial sectors while all the other surveys have five or more. If that were the case, the industcat ex-post harmonized variable would not capture all the valuable information on industrial sectors across countries. The benchmark approach refers to harmonizing each variable according to a previously established ideal definition. For instance, tt the beginning of the project, it could be agreed that the ideal number of industrial sectors should be ten (1 agriculture, 2 mining, 3 manufacturing, etc.). It would not matter whether any of the surveys has ten categories for industrial sectors. If some of them have more, then it would be necessary to aggregate some of the categories into broader ones. If some of them have less categories than ten, it might not be possible to disaggregate some of these categories into smaller ones. As you may imagine, no approach to harmonization is perfect. However, SARMD follows the benchmark approach. The main reason for choosing this approach is that household surveys get better over time, and the minimum common denominator approach applied to both old and new surveys would inevitably drag down the content of SARMD to the old surveys’ methodological structure. In contrast, the benchmark approach takes advantage of the structure of new surveys. Once the benchmark stops reflecting the features of newer surveys, there is always room for updating and refining the benchmark and readapting old surveys to it. Despite the disadvantages of ex–post harmonization, harmonized variables in SARMD may be used for research purposes in many ways. For example, household access to at least one bicycle (Yes=1, No=0) is averaged at a subnational (state or province) level and plotted in a map for the most recent survey available in each country. Even though survey characteristics vary, and data comes from different years, having access to a bicycle seems to be significantly more common for households in Eastern India than in other areas of South Asia. FIGURE 1.1: this is a test Complementary visualizations of this book Many of the graphs in this book are interactive Tableau dashboards. As the example above (Figure 1.1), you can see not only share of households witn access to bicycle in each subnational region of SAR, but also you may filter the results by a differente asset such as computer of cellphone, or even select a different category of variable such as demographic or education variables.By using the filters provided you may explore SARMD and learn what kind of data is available to study household welfare. Parts of the book This book provides the user of SARMD a complete understanding of the harmonization of variables in three main areas: Part 1 presents the metadata analysis of SARMD, which may be broadly described as an overview of the household survey questionnaires and other survey characteristics. This part studies the household surveys’ raw data, sampling methodology, coverage, data capturing methods, and ability to measure food, non-food, durables, and housing expenditures. Part 2 presents the harmonized variables in SARMD. The names of harmonized variables in this book are always emphasized as country, year, wgt, hsize, age, male, bicycle to help identify harmonized variables more easily. We inspect the quality of these harmonized variables and verify that each harmonized variable has been constructed properly. Two kinds of quality checks of the harmonized data have been conducted. A static quality check evaluates the coherence of each variable and its consistency with the rest of the variables in the dataset. At the individual level, for example, the variable age, which refers to the age of the individual, might be required to pass the following quality checks: It should not have negative values (internal coherence) age&gt;=0 All of its values should fall within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-120)1 0&lt;=age&lt;=120 The number of years of education of an individual educy should not be greater than age (internal consistency with other variables) educy&lt;age At the household level, for example, a high number of households that report having access to a television while not having access to electricity, that is, television==1 &amp; electricity==0, may raise questions on whether these variables were harmonized correctly or whether the inconsistency comes from the raw data. On the other hand, a dynamic quality check evaluates the inconsistencies in measurement of harmonized data and provides a better overview on whether categorical variables have changed over time. We tab the absolute and relative frequencies for the categories in categorical variables such as marital, urban, and educat7. In this section, it is also possible to see how the poverty dummy indicator used to generate extreme poverty headcounts, poor_int, changes over time. Inequality measures for welfare are also presented over time. Part 3 presents a set of socioeconomic findings at the regional level using SARMD. Each of these findings is a brief example of the potential analyses that may be conducted using SARMD. These examples provide the Stata code that may be used to replicate the results. That way, users become more familiar with SARMD and may use these pieces of code as starting points for their own projects. Even though it is possible to find in surveys people older than 120 years, it is not only unlikely, but also problematic for anonymization.↩ "]
