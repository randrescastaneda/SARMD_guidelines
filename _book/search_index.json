The following Tableau dashboards display which variables are currently available for each household survey. The different colors indicate a variable’s percentage of missing values. 5.1 Basic survey characteristics countrycode veralt pop_wgt subnatid2 year idh int_year psu survey idp int_month strata vermast wgt subnatid1 spdef The essential variables that identify each dataset are countrycode, year, survey, vermast, veralt, idh, and idp. Weights are defined as wgt and pop_wgt=wgtxhsize. The dates of the survey are recorded as int_year and int_month. The geographical location within the country’s administrative division is recorded as subnatid1, and in some cases, subnatid2 may provide a more specific location. psu strata spdef 5.2 Demographic variables There are currently six essential demographic variables in SARMD: age, male (0/1), hsize, relationcs, relationharm and marital. 5.2.1 age The youngest country in the region is Afghanistan. 5.2.2 hsize Household size is close to seven in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Maldives, and much closer to 4-5 in the rest of the countries. 5.2.3 male Sex ratio is used to describe the number of females per 1000 of males. In India, and some other countries in South Asia, this ratio may be heavily skewed towards men. 5.2.4 relationcs 5.2.5 relationharm 5.2.6 marital Population pyramids such as the one provided in Figure 5.1 allow to see how countries’ demographics change over time while showing whether the marital status of individuals has been harmonized adequately. About 63.7 percent of Afghans are under 25 years of age, reflecting a steep pyramid age structure. Figure 5.1: Population Pyramid for Afghanistan (2013) 5.3 Education atschool ed_mod_age everattend literacy educat4 educat5 educat7 educy The adult literacy rate – referring to the population aged 15 and over – is an indicator that measures the accumulated achievement of the education system. The youth literacy rate – the literacy rate in the population aged 15-24 – reflects the outcomes of primary education over roughly the previous 10 years and is a measure of recent educational progress. 5.4 Durable assets bicycle computer landphone refrigerator buffalo cow motorcar sewing machine cellphone fan motorcycle television chicken lamp radio washing machine This section analyzes whether the sixteen asset variables in SARMD have been adequately harmonized and may be used for research purposes. These binary variables (Yes=1, No=0) represent whether households have access to a particular durable asset. The variables are defined at the household level and do not represent whether each individual owns an asset in particular, but whether the household as a whole has access to it. The harmonization of these asset variables is limited by their availability in the household questionnaire. For example, cow, chicken, and buffalo cannot be harmonized if a survey does not cover live-stocking activities. It may also be that some of these assets are unnecessary (a fan in cold weather), obsolete (land phone), or too basic (lamp) to be included in a questionnaire. Quality checks were conducted to make sure that these variables could only be equal to 0 or 1. We also verified that the value was the same within each household. A deeper look at these asset variables allowed to identify some interesting trends. Figure 5.2 displays the percentage of households that have access to an asset by country for the latest survey round available. It shows that cellphones are the most accessible assets and that there can be a wide range between the minimum and the maximum. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./figures/Assets.png&quot;) Figure 5.2: Harmonized asset ownership in latest household survey round see Figure 5.2 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Assets knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./figures/Scatter.png&quot;) Figure 5.3: Access to refrigerator and access to electricity across surveys see Figure 5.3 at https://tab.worldbank.org/#/site/WBG/views/SAR_MNA_Summary/Scatter Figure 5.3 shows a clear exponential trend between the percentage of households that have access to electricity and the percentage of households that have access to a refrigerator. A similar relationship with electricity was found for television, washing machine, and fan. A quality check was conducted to identify the number of observations where the household had no access to electricity, but still had access to an asset. In some cases, it might seem illogical, for example, for a household to own a television if it does not have access to electricity. In Afghanistan (2013), 7,771 out of 20,773 households seemed to have a television and no electricity. However, a mistake in the harmonization process was identified and this number was reduced to 3,119 out of 20,773 households once the mistake was fixed. Still, 13-20% of observations in Afghanistan have consistently reported having a television and no electricity. 5.5 Housing The living conditions of the Afghan population are to a large extent determined by the conditions of housing, including facilities for drinking water and sanitation. Most people – 83 percent – live in dwellings that are constructed with non-durable materials and 44 percent live in conditions of overcrowding, meaning that there are more than three persons per room. The large majority of urban dwellers – 72 percent – live in slums or inadequate housing. 5.6 Labor 5.7 Welfare 5.7.1 Poverty This section presents the latest data on regional extreme poverty rates using the international poverty line of US$1.90 in 2011 purchasing power parity dollars. Even though, Afghanistan is missing, the ALCS 2016-17 recorded a sharp deterioration in welfare of the Afghan population. The proportion of population living below the national poverty line increased from 34 percent in 2007-08 to 55 percent in 2016-17. The latest poverty figures imply that at the time of the survey, close to 16 million Afghans lived in poverty. Urban poverty lower than rural poverty. datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(GMD) mod(ALL) vermast(01) veralt(02) surveyid(PSLM) gen welf_ppp = welfare/cpi2011/icp2011/365 gen poor190 = welf_ppp &lt; 1.9 sum poor190 [aw=weight_h] 5.7.2 Inequality The Gini index for Afghanistan showed a small decrease between the surveys of 2011-12 and 2016-17, from 0.30 to 0.29.
