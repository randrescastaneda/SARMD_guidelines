For all countries in the region, cell phone users have significantyl grew. Only X percent of people living in low- and middle-income countries had access to mobile phones. In XX, that number rose to a whopping XX percent. This was true even in sub-Saharan Africa, where there were 76 mobile cellular subscriptions for every 100 people, while only 68 percent of the region’s population had access to an improved water source. Even among those who don’t have access to electricity still have access to cell phone which implies lower entry barriers to obtain them. Why do they have rapid increase in cell phone usage?
