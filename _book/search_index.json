This is why, the entire collection is only avaialable through the datalibweb system. Datalibweb is a data system specifically designed to enable users to access the most up to date versions of non-harmonized (original/raw) and harmonized datasets of different collections across Global Practices. SARMD is one of them. This section, thus, is mainly a compilation of excerpts from the documentaiton provided by the Global Team for Statistical Development (GTSD) in the Poverty and Equity Global practice. Using the Datalibweb system has several advantage: * Instant access to raw and harmonized surveys ready to use for country or regional level analysis. * Automatically generated time-deflated variables and poverty lines. * User friendly interactive interface in Stata * A suitable Stata command for replicability, research, and programing purposes. * Ability to combine different country surveys and survey years. * Merging raw data and modules of harmonized collections on the fly (option in progress). 1.1 Request access to the system Access to regional harmonized collections like SARMD or to the original/raw dataset is not given to users automatically—as it is the case with global harmonization such as the GMD—unless the dataset is marked with Public access for internal use, which is not the case for SARMD. Users need to contact the regional/collection focal point and ask for permission to use the data. Each user will have different profiles of subscription to the different collections and surveys depending on the purpose of the work in which the data is going to be used. Without any subscription, users will be able to check the availability of the data, and query relevant metadata of all surveys. To get access to the SARMD, send an email to Francisco Javier Parada Gomez Urquiza and the datalibweb team, specifying the following: Small description of the project in which you’re planning to use and what is the survey or collection. Who is the TTL in charge of the project. Names and UPIs of the people who will be working directly with that data 1.2 Install the datalibweb command in Stata The Datalibweb system can be accessed through the datalibweb Stata command. This command is already installed in all the computers of the World Bank with an official Stata licence. In case it is not installed in your computer you could do the following 1.2.1 Option 1. Direct Installation Close all Stata sessions Enter the following lines in Stata net from &quot;http://eca/povdata/datalibweb/_ado&quot;` net install datalibweb 1.2.2 Option 2. Manual Installation Get the file from this link Copy with replacement all the files into c:/ado, without changing the folder structure. 1.3 Filename structure All the data filenames in the SARMD repository follow the convention established by the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) on archiving and managin data. This structure can be generalized as follows CCC_YYYY_SSSS_ vNN_M_vNN_A_TYPE_MODULE where, CCC refers to 3 letter ISO country code YYYY refers to Survey year when data collection started SSSS refers to Survey acronym (e.g., LSMS, CWIQ, HBS, etc.) vNN is the version vintage of the raw/master data if followed by an M or of the alternative/adapted data if followed by an A. The first version will always be v01, and when a newer version is available it should be named sequentially (e.g. v02, v03, etc.). Note that when a new version is available, the previous one(s) must still be kept. TYPE refers to the collection name. In the case of the South Asia region the user would refer to the SARMD or, at the global level, to the GMD collection type. MODULE refers to the module of the collection. In the case of SARMD it could be IND, which refers to the questions at the individual level, or FULL, which refers to the whole survey. For example, if the user wanted to load the most recent version of the harmonized, Pakistani Household Survey of 2015, he would refer to the file PAK_2015_PSLM_v01_M_v02_A_SARMD_IND.dta. In this case, PSLM refers to the acronym of the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey, v01_N shows that the version of the raw data has not changed since it is still 01, and v02_A shows that the most recent version of the harmonization is 02. 1.4 Using datalibweb Using datalibweb is straigtforward. You may read the help file, which is detailed and clear, but you can also dive right in to get your data by loading it in one of the followinf ways: 1.4.1 Clicking into the Stata results window As user, you can get access to the data in two ways. First, you could type datalibweb in Stata and hit Enter. Then, lick SAR on the results window of Stata and then click on the ISO code of your country of preference; PAK in this case. then, select either the modules of the collection or its vintages next to SARMD. Finally, if went for the former, click 01-02, which refers to the version of the harmonization, to load the data. 1.4.2 Providing the complete datalibweb syntax Alternatively, and more efficient when coding, you may type the following like to load your data, datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) vermast(01) veralt(02) survey(PSLM) clear In fact, given that you there is only one survey in 2015 in Pakistan and you are interested in the most recent version, the code above could be contracted to, datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) clear Only when you need previous version of the data or there is more than one survey in the same year for the same country, you need to specify the name of the country and the version. Otherwise, you should code as above. 1.5 Citing datalibweb: datalibweb is a Stata program developed and supported by the Global Poverty Team for Statistical Development of the World Bank, contributed by many different teams: Stata front-end application: Minh Cong Nguyen, R. Andrés Castañeda Aguilar, José Montes, and João Pedro Azevedo, with support from Paul Andres Corral Rodas. Plugin, IT coordinator/support: Paul Ricci, Louis Wahsieh Elliott, Antonio Ramos-Izquierdo. SharePoint web application: Intekhab Alam Sheikh, Monisha Menon, Nishant Nitin Trivedi. Overall datalibweb project supervision: João Pedro Azevedo and Minh Cong Nguyen. datalibweb was based on the initial effort of datalib created by R.Andrés Castañeda Aguilar and João Pedro Azevedo in LAC TSD; and Datalib2 created by Cesar Cancho and João Pedro Azevedo in ECA TSD. Please cite the use of datalibweb and SARMD in one or several of the following ways depending on the nature of your work. “Source: SARMD (SARTSD/World Bank)” “Source: SARMD Harmonization (SARTSD)” SARTSD 2019 DATALIBWEB: SARMD Ex-post Harmonization.
