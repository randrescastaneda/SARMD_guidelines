Still, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, progress in poverty reduction needs to continue in India and the rest of South Asia. The latest poverty measures from the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018) are shown in Table 3.1: Table 3.1: Poverty Measures in Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018) Country Survey year(s) Population Number of poor (millions) Poverty rate (%) Poverty gap (%) Poverty gap/rate (%) India 2011.5 1311.19 175.7 13.42 2.4 17.7 Bangladesh 2010 and 2016 160.53 24.4 15.16 2.8 18.1 Pakistan 2013.5 and 2015.5 190.38 9.9 5.23 0.7 13.2 Nepal 2010.17 28.57 2.0 7.03 1.4 19.8 Sri Lanka 2012.5 and 2016 25.00 0.2 0.77 0.1 11.7 Bhutan 2012 and 2017 0.81 0.0 1.66 0.3 16.3 Maldives 2009.5 0.37 0.0 4.08 0.8 20.3 Afghanistan NA 35.53 NA NA NA NA Based on the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018), we can provide the following highlights: In 2015, South Asia accounted for 29% of the people living in extreme poverty worldwide (216 million extreme poor in South Asia out of the estimated 736 million extreme poor worldwide). Four out of five extreme poor in the South Asia region reside in India. Despite a poverty rate of 13.42 percent, India’s large population of 1.3 billion results in a high absolute number of poor (approximately 176 million poor people in 2015). Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, but its large population still maintains it in second place within the region in terms of absolute number of poor (24.4 million extreme poor in 2016). The third place is Pakistan, which has a larger population than Bangladesh, but a smaller amount of extreme poor (9.9 million extreme poor in 2015). Pakistan has seen a consistent and significant decline in poverty over the 14 years from 2001 to 2015. Bhutan and Sri Lanka are considered development success stories where extreme poverty has become rare, although a large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the extreme poverty line. In the Maldives, extreme poverty is nearly nonexistent according to the latest survey data. Even as much of the region leaves extreme poverty behind, poverty is becoming more entrenched and harder to root out in certain areas, particularly in countries burdened by violent conflict and weak institutions. Nepal experienced devastating earthquakes in 2015 and remains predominantly rural, with the highest share of labor force in agriculture (73%) in the region as of 2016. The Maldives were devastated by the 2004 tsunami while its tourism industry is seriously threatened by climate change. In the case of Afghanistan, poverty is increasing as violence continues to affect the security of livelihoods and economic activity in the country. The World Bank’s poverty and inequality measures for South Asia provided by PovcalNet are described in Table 3.2 and may be accessed by interacting with figure 3.1: Figure 3.1: Average of harmonized variables at subnational level Table 3.2: Poverty Measures in PovcalNet Measure Description Gini A measure of inequality between 0 (everyone has the same income) and 100 (richest person has all the income). Headcount % of population living in households with consumption per person below the poverty line. Mean Average monthly household per capita consumption expenditure from the survey in 2011 PPP. Median Median of monthly household per capita consumption expenditure from the survey in 2011 PPP. MLD Mean log deviation is an index of inequality, given by the mean across the population of the log of the overall mean divided by individual income. Population Country’s population in millions. Povgap The mean shortfall of income from the poverty line. The mean is based on the entire population treating the nonpoor as having a shortfall of zero, and the shortfall is expressed as a proportion of the poverty line. Povline Poverty line in 2011 PPP per day. The default poverty line is $1.90 per day. Squared The mean squared shortfall of income from the poverty line. The mean is based on the entire population treating the nonpoor as having a shortfall of zero, and the shortfall is expressed as a proportion of the poverty line (and then squared). Watts This is the mean across the population of the proportionate poverty gaps, as measured by the log of the ratio of the poverty line to income, where the mean is formed over the whole population, counting the nonpoor as having a zero poverty gap.
