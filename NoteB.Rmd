One of the most unexpected phenomenena in developing countries is that more people have access to mobile phones even than to electricity. South Asia region is no exception for this developmen as cell phone users have significantly grew in all countries. Even among those who don't have access to electricity still have access to cell phones.

With the exception of Afganistan, at least 80 percent of total population has access to cell phone in most recent years. In Nepal, the percentage of access to cell phone was less than 1 percent in 2003 but the ownership rate has jumped to 90 percent within 13 years. Even in other countries, 9 out of 10 housesholds own cell phones. 

Another interesting finding is that Some households with cell phones live out of electricity. In Bangladesh and Nepal, 68.4 and 89.9 percent of households have access to cell phone but about 12.8 and 15.3 percen of those cell phone holders do not have electricity in their dwelling. This implies higher entry barriers for accessing basic infrastructure in developing countries as financial resources and administrative capacity are limited in those countries.

Sharp growth in the access to cell phone presents greater opportnunities for developing countries.Effective usage of technology may help compensate the shortage of infrastructure in those countries. Low participation in development aid projects shows limited accessibility of aid programs among vulnerable households who need assistance as well. Cell phones have been widely used in eduation, health and agriculture sectors by efficiently sharing knowledge with people without any costs. 

One prominent example of using this digital development is a mobile banking platform which already started to grow in India and Bangladesh with the aid of many development agencies. This mobile money transfer service allows users to pay for everyday goods and services, take out and repay loans, and send remittances to family in remote locations.

Technology may not address development challenges alone in SAR, but facilitating the usage of cell phones in development projects may help reducing poverty more effectively.
