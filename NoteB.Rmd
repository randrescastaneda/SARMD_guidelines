One of the most unexpected phenomenena in developing countries is a sharp increase in the access to access to cell phones. South Asia region has also experienced this development. Cell phone users have significantly grew in all countries and even among those who don't have access to electricity still have access to cell phones.

With the exception of Afganistan, at least 80 percent of total population has access to cell phone in most recent years. In Nepal, the percentage of access to cell phone was less than 1 percent in 2003 but the ownership rate has jumped to 90 percent within 13 years. Even in other countries, 9 out of 10 housesholds own cell phones on average. 

Another interesting finding is that some households live without electricity but still have access to cell phones. In Bangladesh and Nepal, 68.4 and 89.9 percent of households have access to cell phone but about 12.8 and 15.3 percen of those cell phone holders do not have electricity in their dwelling. This implies higher entry barriers for accessing the public infrastructure since financial resources and administrative capacity are limited in those countries compared to obtaining cell phones.

The sharp growth of the access to cell phone presents greater opportnunities for the region. Effective usage of technology such as cell phone may help compensate the shortage of infrastructure inherent in those countries. Also, low participation in development aid projects due to limited accessibility among vulnerable households can be improved since most households have cell phones. 

Many development aid institutions alealdy started utilizing cell phone applicatins in eduation, health and agriculture sectors by efficiently sharing knowledge with less expensive costs. One prominent example of taking advantage of this digital development is a mobile banking platform which has largely grown in India and Bangladesh. Mobile money transfer service allows users to pay for everyday goods and services, take out and repay loans, and send remittances to family in remote locations. Researchers have actively provided empirical evidence that the usage of mobile banking helps reducing poverty and enhancing living conditions. 

Technology has the potential to facilitate poverty reduction by overcoming obstacles of accessing important services among poor people. In maximizing such benefits, more investments on infrastructure will be crucial to make people use cell phones freely, and continued development in the software that enables knowledge sharing will help reducing poverty more effectively.
