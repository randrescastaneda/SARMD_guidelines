# Welfare and Emplomeny by Industry {#note-industry}
***

Services and manufacturing industry have consistently favored non-poor households, and the difference of welfare level among sectors has increased over time. Countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Pakistan have consistent labor market indicators and welfare aggregates, allowing for analyzing the industrial composition and its trend in the labor markets. Figure below shows that the service sector, followed by manufacturing and agriculture, pays higher income and thus leads to more consumption of households. The gap of average consumption between service and agriculture becomes larger over time in three countries. In Bhutan and Pakistan, the welfare aggregate in service industry is abour two times higher than the one in agriculture. In order to investigate such gap further, the share of employment by industry can be compared at different welfare levels.

```

Households in the bottom quintile rely on agriculture whereas rich households mostly work in the service sector. For example, in Bhutan, even though the share of employment in agriculture has gradually decreased, about 90 percent of households in the bottom quintile belong to agriculture and more than 40 percent of the richest households earn their income from service industry. 

Despite such difference in terms of the reliance on agriculture, the share of agriculture employment has declined over time more evidently among bottom 20 groups. More than half of the poorest households depended on agriculture about 20 years ago in Bangladesh and Bhutan, but they moved to different sectors pursuing better income, lowering the share by about 7 and 40 percent respectively. Pakistan is an exception where the share of agriculture employment among poor households increased from 44.7 percent in 2010 to 58.2 percent in 2015. 

The employment share in the manufacturing sector increased modestly in Bhutan and Pakistan, but a large increase occurred in the service sector. In Bangladesh, however, due to a sharp growth in garment industry, the percent of employment in manufacturing has risen up to 24 percent and 31.4 percent in bottom and top quintile groups.

Overall, the trends in employment share among different quintile groups emphasize the growth of service sector in the region. Many development and trade economists argued that globalization may lead developing countries to specialize in either primary or secondary industry including agriculture. However, unlike their expectation, those countries have been gradually dominated by service sectors.

On the other side, the prevalence of agriculture workers among the poorest households implies the importance of productivity improvement in the agriculture sector. Compared to service and manufacturing industry, welfare level has not been enhanced among households in agriculture. Government policies and business development to increase its productivity will facilitate reducing poverty in the region.
