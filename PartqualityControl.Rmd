***
The third part of the book presents the harmonized variables in SARMD and provides the results of conducting a quality check (qckeck) on these variables. 

**Chapter 7** provides a dictionary of harmonized variables. It presents all the harmonized variables available in SARMD. 

**Chapter 8**  tabulates the frequencies in the values of categorical variables.   

**Chapter 9** presents the frequency of missing values and zeros in the variables. 

**Chapter 10** provides a static quality check for variables within a given survey. This flexible tool allows to evaluate the frequency of a given condition, for example, `if television==1 & electricity==0`.
