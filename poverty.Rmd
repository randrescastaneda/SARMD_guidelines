# Poverty measures in South Asia
***

The World Bank set a target of reducing extreme poverty to [less than 3 percent by 2030](https://sdg-tracker.org/no-poverty) and to ensure continued focus and steady progress toward the goal, the institution set an interim target of 9 percent by 2020. Progress towards this goal is measured by monitoring the share of the global population living below the international poverty line, currently set at US$1.90 in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars. All eight countries in South Asia measure the international extreme poverty status of an individual by comparing consumption expenditures per capita against this poverty line. 

Even as much of the region leaves extreme poverty behind, poverty is becoming more entrenched and harder to root out in certain areas, particularly in countries burdened by violent conflict and weak institutions. Nepal experienced devastating earthquakes in 2015 and remains predominantly rural, with the highest share of labor force in agriculture (73%) in the region as of 2016. The Maldives were devastated by the 2004 tsunami while its tourism industry is seriously threatened by climate change. In the case of Afghanistan, poverty is increasing as violence continues to affect the security of livelihoods and economic activity in the country. 

In this chapter, we will present two main sources of poverty measures: the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report and PovcalNet. 

## Poverty and shared prosperity report {-}

According to the [Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018)](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), the number of extreme poor in South Asia dropped to 216 million people in 2015, compared to half a billion in 1990, and Nigeria may already have overtaken India as the country with the most extreme poor in the world. Still, to achieve the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/), progress in poverty reduction needs to continue in India and the rest of South Asia. 

Figure \@ref(fig:nicemap2) presents the latest extreme poverty headcounts available in the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report.

knitr::include_graphics("figures/fake_figure.PNG")
```

The latest poverty measures from the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018) are also shown in Table \@ref(tab:psprtb):

```{r psprtb, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, error=FALSE, results='markup', tidy=TRUE, cache=FALSE}

pspr <- readr::read_csv("./tables/pspr.csv",col_names = TRUE, col_types = cols())

# Table
knitr::kable(pspr,booktabs=TRUE, caption = 'Measures in Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report 2018')
```

As expected, larger countries have a larger number of poor. However, note how Figure \@ref(fig:psprfg) clearly shows that Pakistan, which has a larger population than Bangladesh, proportionally has a smaller amount of extreme poor. 

```{r psprfg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "South Asia region shares of poor and total population by country", fig.align = 'left'}
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# 
# # Simple Pie Chart
# slices <- unlist(pspr[1:5,4])
# lbls <- unlist(pspr[1:5,1])
# pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Extreme poor by country")
# 
# # Simple Pie Chart
# slices <- unlist(pspr[1:8,3])
# lbls <- unlist(pspr[1:8,1])
# pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Population by country", font=1)
# 
# # ggplot
# # Barplot
# bp<- ggplot(pspr, aes(x="", y=slices, fill=lbls))+
#   geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")
# pie <- bp + coord_polar("y", start=0)
# 

pspr %>% 
  tidyr::gather(`Number of poor (millions)`, Population, key = "set", value = "Npeople") %>% 
  select(Country, set, Npeople) %>% 
  arrange(Npeople) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = set, y = Npeople, fill = Country)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Share of SAR population")

```

Based on the [Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report (2018)](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), we can provide the following highlights circa 2015:

> - South Asia accounted for 29% of the people living in extreme poverty worldwide (216 million extreme poor in South Asia out of the estimated 736 million extreme poor worldwide). 
> - Four out of five extreme poor in the South Asia region resided in India. Despite a poverty rate of 13.42 percent, India’s large population of 1.3 billion results in a high absolute number of poor (175.7 million poor people). 
- Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, but its large population still maintained it in second place within the region in terms of absolute number of poor (24.4 million extreme poor). 
- The third place is Pakistan, which has a larger population than Bangladesh, but a smaller amount of extreme poor (9.9 million extreme poor). Pakistan has seen a consistent and significant decline in poverty over the 14 years from 2001 to 2015. 
- Bhutan and Sri Lanka are considered development success stories where extreme poverty has become rare, although a large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the extreme poverty line. 
- In the Maldives, extreme poverty is nearly nonexistent according to the latest survey data.

## PovcalNet {-}

[PovcalNet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/home.aspx) is an interactive computational tool that allows you to replicate the calculations made by the World Bank's researchers in estimating the extent of absolute poverty in the world. The World Bank’s poverty and inequality measures for South Asia provided by [PovcalNet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/home.aspx) are described in Table \@ref(tab:povcalnet) and may be accessed by interacting with Figure \@ref(fig:povcalnetdata):
