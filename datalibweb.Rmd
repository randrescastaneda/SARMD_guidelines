# Datalibweb: Getting Access to SARMD
***

SARMD is only available through the [datalibweb](http://globalpractices.worldbank.org/teamsites/Poverty/GPDP/SitePages/datalibweb.aspx) system to guarantee replicability, security, and efficiency. Datalibweb is a data system specifically designed to enable users to access the most up-to-date versions of non-harmonized (original raw data) and harmonized datasets of different collections across Global Practices. SARMD is one collection among other collections available through datalibweb. This section provides reference to the documentation provided by the [Global Team for Statistical Development](http://globalpractices.worldbank.org/teamsites/Poverty/GPDP/SitePages/Main.aspx) (GTSD) in the Poverty and Equity Global Practice. 

Using the datalibweb system has several advantages:

* Instant access to raw and harmonized surveys ready to use for country or regional level analysis
* Automatically generated time-deflated variables and poverty lines
* User friendly interactive interface  in Stata
* A suitable Stata command for replicability, research, and programing purposes
* Ability to combine different country surveys and survey years
* Merging raw data and modules of harmonized collections on the fly (option in progress)


## Request access to the system
Unlike GMD, access to regional harmonized collections like SARMD or to the original raw datasets is not given to users automatically . Most datasets in SARMD are not public and the user must be granted access for internal use. Each user must submit a request for the different collections and surveys specifying the purpose of the data request. Users must contact the regional/collection focal point and ask for permission to use the data. Without any subscription, users will only be able to check the availability of the data, and query relevant metadata of all surveys.  

To get access to SARMD, send an email to  [Francisco Javier Parada Gomez Urquiza](mailto:fparadagomezurqu@worldbank.org) and the [datalibweb team](mailto:datalibweb@worldbank.org), specifying the following:

* Small description of the project in which you are planning to use the data 
* Particular survey, country, year or collection that you are interested in accessing
* Who is the TTL in charge of the project
* Names and UPIs of the people who will be working directly with the data

## Install the `datalibweb` command in Stata

The Datalibweb system can be accessed through the `datalibweb` Stata command. This command is already installed in all World Bank computers with an official Stata licence. In case it is not installed on your computer, you could do the following:

### Option 1. Direct Installation {-}
* Close all Stata sessions
* Enter the following lines in Stata 
```
net from "http://eca/povdata/datalibweb/_ado"`
net install datalibweb
```

### Option 2. Manual Installation {-}
* Get the file from this [link](http://eca/povdata/datalibweb/_ado/datalibweb.zip)
* Copy with replacement all the files into c:/ado, without changing the folder structure.

## Filename structure
All the data filenames in the SARMD repository follow the convention established by the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) for [archiving and managing data](http://www.ihsn.org/archiving). This structure can be generalized as follows:

```
CCC_YYYY_SSSS_ vNN_M_vNN_A_TYPE_MODULE
```
where, 

* `CCC`  refers to 3 letter ISO country code
* `YYYY` refers to survey year when data collection started
* `SSSS` refers to survey acronym (e.g., LSMS, CWIQ, HBS, etc.)
* `vNN`  is the version vintage of the raw/master data if followed by an `M` or of the alternative/adapted data if followed by an `A`. The first version will always be v01, and when a newer version is available it should be named sequentially (e.g. v02, v03, etc.). Note that when a new version is available, the previous ones must still be kept.
* `TYPE` refers to the collection name. In the case of the South Asia region the user would refer to SARMD or, at the global level, to the GMD collection type. 
* `MODULE` refers to the module of the collection. In the case of SARMD, it could be `IND`, which refers to the questions at the individual level, or `FULL`, which refers to the whole survey. 

For example, if the user wanted to load the most recent version of the harmonized Pakistani Household Survey of 2015, she would refer to the file `PAK_2015_PSLM_v01_M_v02_A_SARMD_IND.dta`. In this case, PSLM refers to the acronym of the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey. v01_M means that the version of the raw data has not changed since it is still the first. v02_A means that the most recent version of the harmonization is 02. 


## Using `datalibweb`
Using `datalibweb` is straightforward. You may read the help file, which is detailed and clear, but you may also dive right in to get your data. There are two possible ways to access a dataset:


### Clicking on the Stata results window  {-}
You may  access the data by typing `datalibweb` in Stata and hitting Enter. Then, click `SAR` on Stata's results window and then click on the ISO code of your country of preference. Click `PAK` in this case. Then, select either the modules of the collection or its vintages next to `SARMD`. Finally, click `01-02`, which refers to the version of the harmonization, to load the data. 

### Providing the complete datalibweb syntax  {-}
Alternatively, a more efficient method when coding is to type the following to load your data:

`datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) vermast(01) veralt(02) survey(PSLM) clear`

Because there is only one survey for Pakistan in 2015 and you are interested in the most recent version, you could access that same dataset with a shorter version of the command: 

`datalibweb, country(PAK) year(2015) type(SARMD) clear`

Only when you request a previous version of the dataset or when there is more than one survey available for a country in a given year, you would need to specify the name of the survey and the version. Otherwise, you may just use the shorter command. 


## Citing datalibweb:

`datalibweb` is a Stata program developed and supported by the Global Poverty Team for Statistical Development of the World Bank, with the contribution of many different teams: 

* Stata front-end application: Minh Cong Nguyen, R. Andrés Castañeda Aguilar, José Montes, and João Pedro Azevedo, with support from Paul Andres Corral Rodas.

* Plugin, IT coordinator/support: Paul Ricci, Louis Wahsieh Elliott, Antonio Ramos-Izquierdo.

* SharePoint web application: Intekhab Alam Sheikh, Monisha Menon, Nishant Nitin Trivedi.

* Overall datalibweb project supervision: João Pedro Azevedo and Minh Cong Nguyen. 

`datalibweb` was based on the initial effort of `datalib` created by R. Andrés Castañeda Aguilar and João Pedro Azevedo in LAC TSD; and Datalib2 created by Cesar Cancho and João Pedro Azevedo in ECA TSD.

Please cite the use of `datalibweb` and SARMD in one or several of the following ways depending on the nature of your work.
